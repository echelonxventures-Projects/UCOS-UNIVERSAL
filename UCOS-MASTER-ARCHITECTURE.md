# UCOS Ω∞ — Universal Capability Operating System
## Master Architecture & Build Specification (Consolidated, Canonical)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document ID | `UCOS-MASTER-ARCH` |
| Author | Bipin Kumar |
| Version | 1.4.0 (75 amendments applied, A-01…A-75; see §35) |
| Status | Canonical — supersedes every architecture fragment in `Chat.txt` |
| Date | 2026-10-03 |
| Audience | Platform architects, engineers, designers, SRE, security, compliance, and AI coding agents |
| Normative keywords | **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **MAY** as defined in RFC 2119 |

> **This is the single context document for building UCOS.** Every earlier layer list, universe list, factory pipeline and constitution fragment has been merged here, de-duplicated, and given exactly one canonical home. Where the source material was aspirational ("infinite", "every product ever known", "multi-planet"), this document turns it into an engineering mechanism that can actually be built, tested and certified. Section 33 maps every source concept to its home.

> **v1.1 companion documents.** This document stays the constitution. Four companions hold the detail it points to:
> - `constitutions/`: 82 universe specifications (12 sections each), `COVERAGE-REGISTER.md`, `TEMPORAL-BINDING-MATRIX.md` and `INDUSTRY-PRODUCT-DOMAIN-CATALOGUE.md`;
> - `engineering/`: `KERNEL-DESIGN.md` and `PHASE1-READINESS.md`;
> - `spec/`: machine-readable schemas, 109 capability manifests, rule facts, Cedar policies, decisions and reference platform definitions;
> - `tools/ucos_check.py`: the consistency checker that CI runs.
>
> All amendments raised by those documents are applied below and listed in §35.

# PART I — FOUNDATIONS

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 What UCOS is

UCOS Ω∞ is a **platform factory**. It does not hard-code any single application. It composes running platforms (marketplaces, commerce, mobility, media, fintech, ERP, CRM, ITSM, healthcare, government, education and future types) from:

```text
PLATFORM  =  CAPABILITIES  +  CONTEXT  +  POLICIES  +  WORKFLOWS
           +  KNOWLEDGE    +  AI       +  EXPERIENCE +  GOVERNANCE
           —  composed, validated, certified, deployed, observed and evolved from METADATA
```

Core equation: **Application = Capability Composition, NOT custom code.**

```text
Amazon-like      = Identity + Product + Catalog + Inventory + Pricing + Offer + Cart + Order
                   + Payment + Logistics + Review + Recommendation + Marketplace + Analytics
Uber-like        = Identity + Geo + Temporal + Dispatch + Routing + Matching + Dynamic Pricing
                   + Payment + Rating + Tracking
Netflix-like     = Identity + Subscription + Entitlement + Media + Streaming + Recommendation
                   + Billing + Analytics
Salesforce-like  = Identity + CRM + Workflow + Decision + Analytics + AI + Communication
SAP-like         = Identity + ERP + Finance/Ledger + Procurement + Inventory + Manufacturing
                   + Workforce + Analytics
```

### 1.2 What "no code changes" means precisely

The source vision says "without writing new business code". A literal reading can't be built, so this specification defines it precisely:

| Change type | Requires platform source-code change? | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| New tenant, company, marketplace, brand, store | **No** | Platform Definition (metadata) |
| New country, language, currency, tax regime, holiday calendar | **No** | Reference-data registries + jurisdiction packs |
| New product/service type, attribute, taxonomy node, variant | **No** | Ontology/Taxonomy/Attribute registries |
| New workflow, approval chain, SLA, trigger, offer rule, pricing rule | **No** | Workflow DSL, Decision tables, Temporal policies |
| New UI screen, portal, layout, theme, journey | **No** | UI Meta-Model + renderers |
| New compliance control mapping, policy, role | **No** | Compliance-as-code + Policy registry |
| New integration with a system that has a supported protocol | **No** | Connector manifest + mapping |
| Switch AI model/provider | **No** | Model registry + AI gateway routing |
| **New capability primitive** never modelled before (e.g. a new settlement algorithm) | **Yes — once**, as a certified **Capability Pack** | Built once, registered once, certified once, then reused by every tenant |
| New engine type (e.g. a new runtime kind) | Yes — platform release | Governed platform evolution |

**Invariant:** there is never *tenant-specific* or *application-specific* code. Code exists only in (a) the platform kernel and engines, and (b) reusable, certified Capability Packs.

### 1.3 The five things that make UCOS different from a normal SaaS

1. **One meta-model:** every artifact is a Canonical Object with identity, ownership, context, lifecycle, policy, audit and evidence (§7).
2. **Capability Genome:** every capability ships as a self-describing manifest with data, API, events, workflows, UI, policies, security, compliance, tests and docs (§8).
3. **Composition Substrate:** a deterministic resolver turns a business intent into a full blueprint and **finds what is missing** (§11).
4. **Completeness gate:** no platform activates while `mandatory_gap_count > 0` or uncertified artifacts exist (§11.6, §28).
5. **Knowledge Once:** global registries (time, geography, currency, products, services, regulations) are authored once and referenced everywhere (§9, §10).

## 2. How to Use This Document

### 2.1 Reading order

| Role | Read first | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Architect / Tech lead | §1, §3, §5, §6, §7, §8, §11 | everything |
| Backend engineer | §7, §8, §13–§17 | §18–§20 |
| Frontend / designer | §22–§25 | §7.3, §8, §15 |
| SRE / Platform | §13, §14, §26, §27 | §19, §28 |
| Security / Compliance | §18–§21 | §28 |
| AI coding agent | §34 **first**, then §3, §7, §8 | the section relevant to the task |
| Universe implementer | §6.2 row → `constitutions/U<NN>-*/constitution.md` | `spec/capabilities/packs/<id>.yaml`, `TEMPORAL-BINDING-MATRIX.md` |

### 2.2 Conventions

- IDs: `ucos:<kind>:<ulid>` (§7.2). Capability IDs: `<universe>.<capability>` e.g. `commerce.cart`.
- Event names: `<universe>.<object>.<pastTenseVerb>` e.g. `order.order.placed` (§15.5).
- All schemas are expressed in YAML for readability; the runtime stores them as JSON Schema 2020-12.
- Diagrams use Mermaid (renders in GitHub, GitLab, VS Code, most doc tools); wireframes use ASCII.
- "Universe" = a bounded context that owns a family of canonical objects. "Capability" = an installable unit of behaviour inside a universe.

### 2.3 Document authority

This document is **Constitution-level** (§18.1). Changes require a Constitutional Change Proposal (CCP) approved by the Architecture Authority (§18.4). Sub-specifications (one per universe, generated per §12.5) MUST NOT contradict it.

## 3. Constitutional Principles & Enforceable Laws

The chat stated more than 40 principles. They are consolidated here into **20 laws**. Each law has an **enforcement mechanism**: a principle with no enforcement mechanism is not a law.

| # | Law | Statement | Enforcement (where / how) |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | **Knowledge Once** | Every fact, definition, rule or reference datum has exactly one canonical home. Author once → register once → certify once → reuse everywhere. | Registry uniqueness constraints; Composition linter rejects duplicate concept definitions (semantic dedupe via ontology `sameAs`); CI check `ucos lint --duplicates`. |
| L2 | **Zero Hard Coding** | No tenant, industry, country, language, currency, gateway, model, workflow, UI or topology is hard-coded in platform or pack code. | Static analysis rules (banned literals: ISO country codes, currency codes, provider names outside adapters); pack certification check; code review checklist. |
| L3 | **Canonical Ownership** | Every object type, capability and registry belongs to exactly one universe and has a named steward. | `owner` and `steward` are required fields in the meta-model; registry rejects orphan entries. |
| L4 | **Zero Duplication / Zero Overlap** | Two capabilities MUST NOT provide the same object type or the same command. | Composition Substrate conflict detector (§11.5); pack publish fails on `provides` collision. |
| L5 | **Zero Orphans** | Every artifact traces up to Constitution → Law → Policy → Capability → Requirement, and down to Test → Evidence → Certification. | Traceability graph check; certification gate `TRACE-001`. |
| L6 | **Composition over Construction** | Applications are compositions of certified capabilities, never bespoke code. | No `apps/<tenant>` code directories permitted; repo policy. |
| L7 | **Context Awareness** | Every execution carries an explicit Context (identity, tenant, jurisdiction, time, locale, channel, risk). | Runtime rejects calls without a resolved `ContextEnvelope` (§7.6). |
| L8 | **Policy before Execution** | No command executes without a policy decision (allow/deny + obligations). | Policy Enforcement Point embedded in the gateway and the command bus; deny-by-default. |
| L9 | **Governed Change** | No change to definitions bypasses governance (proposal → validation → approval → certification → activation). | Definition lifecycle state machine (§7.5); activation requires a `Certification` reference. |
| L10 | **Completeness before Activation** | A platform instance cannot be activated while `mandatory_gap_count > 0` (unless there is an explicit, authorised, time-boxed waiver). | Certification gate `GAP-000` (§11.6). |
| L11 | **Security by Construction** | Zero trust, least privilege, encryption at rest/in transit, tenant isolation are defaults, never options. | Security baseline policies installed at Layer 0; pack certification `SEC-*` checks. |
| L12 | **Compliance by Construction** | Regulatory obligations are resolved from context (jurisdiction × industry × data class × capability) and enforced as controls. | Compliance resolver (§20); evidence collectors; gate `CMP-*`. |
| L13 | **Audit Everything** | Every command, decision, policy evaluation, AI output, approval, deployment and access is recorded immutably. | Append-only audit log with hash chaining (§19.9). |
| L14 | **Observable Everything** | Every capability emits standard traces, metrics, logs and business signals. | Pack certification requires an OTel instrumentation manifest. |
| L15 | **Vendor & Model Agnosticism** | External providers (cloud, PSP, LLM, carrier, tax) are reached only through adapters behind canonical ports. | Port/adapter architecture; dependency rules in build (`packs/*` may not import vendor SDKs except `adapters/*`). |
| L16 | **Versioned & Evolvable** | Every definition is versioned (SemVer), backward-compatibility rules are enforced, and deprecations follow a published timeline. | Schema compatibility checker (§29.4). |
| L17 | **Human Authority over Autonomy** | AI/automation can propose and act only within delegated, bounded authority. Constitutional, security-critical and irreversible financial changes require human approval. | Autonomy levels (§29.2); Authority objects for agents (§21.5). |
| L18 | **Deterministic Composition** | The same Platform Definition + registry snapshot always yields the same blueprint (content-hash identical). | Composer is a pure function; snapshot IDs pinned; reproducibility test in CI. |
| L19 | **Isolation & Sovereignty** | Tenant data, keys and (where required) compute are isolated. Data residency is honoured per jurisdiction. | Cell architecture + RLS + per-tenant keys (§14.3, §19.6). |
| L20 | **Discover the Unknown** | The platform continuously asks *what exists, what is missing, what overlaps, what conflicts, what violates, what should evolve*. | Completeness Engine scheduled scans + on-change scans (§11, §29). |

## 5. Canonical Layer Architecture

### 5.1 Consolidation decision

The source material contains at least **eight incompatible layer numberings** (Layer 000–021, Level 0–14, Layer 0–27, Universe 001–047, Layer A–J, Layer 00–21, Level 0–20, Layer 01–28). They are merged into **one 13-layer model with 4 cross-cutting planes**. Every concept from every numbering maps to exactly one layer (§33).

  L11 --> L12[L12 Certification/Evolution/Autonomy]
  L12 -. proposals .-> L0
```

Rules:
1. A layer MAY depend only on layers below it (arrows point upward to dependents). The **only upward flow** is L12 → L0 *proposals*, which still pass through governance.
2. Business universes (L5) MUST NOT depend on each other directly for data ownership. They reference other universes' objects by `ref` (ID + version) and communicate through events and published queries.
3. Foundation universes (L4) MUST NOT depend on any L5 universe.
4. L8 runtime engines are generic. They MUST NOT contain business-universe-specific code; all business behaviour comes from packs and metadata.

**Control plane vs data plane**
- The **control plane** (global, highly governed) owns definitions: registries, packs, compositions, blueprints, certifications, approvals.
- The **data plane** (one per cell or region, horizontally scaled) executes certified blueprints for tenants. It reads blueprints from a local, signed cache and never mutates definitions.

## 6. Universe Catalog & Canonical Ownership

### 6.1 Domains → Universes

The 72 universes named in the Genesis Directive, plus those added in later turns of the chat, are grouped into 12 domains. These domains also form the Platform Console navigation (§24.1).

> **Coverage expansion (v1.1):** U77–U109 were added by the completeness reviews, so the catalogue now has 109 universes. Industry, product, service and domain coverage is mapped against ISIC, CPC and APQC in `constitutions/INDUSTRY-PRODUCT-DOMAIN-CATALOGUE.md`. `constitutions/COVERAGE-REGISTER.md` maps every domain to its owner and defines the protocol for adding anything new, for any region, planet, reality, language, currency, time system or unit.

### 6.3 Ownership resolution of commonly duplicated concepts

These were the main duplication risks in the source material. The rulings below are binding.

| Concept | Canonical home | Everyone else… |
|---|---|---|
| Any date, time, period, validity, schedule, recurrence, slot, SLA clock, expiry, trigger time | **Temporal (U13)** | stores a `TemporalRef` / `TemporalPolicyRef`, never `start_date`/`end_date` pairs |
| Money, currency, FX | **Currency & Unit (U14)** — `Money` value type; FX rates are temporal facts | MUST use `Money {amount (decimal string), currency}` |
| Address, country, region, jurisdiction, timezone | **Geography (U12)** | references a `Place`/`Jurisdiction` |
| Product master facts (brand, specs, GTIN) | **Product Intelligence (U18)** | tenants create **Listings** (U21) that reference GPID and add tenant-specific data |
| Price | **Pricing (U23)** | Offer applies adjustments; Catalog never stores price |
| Discounts/promotions/coupons | **Offer (U22)** | Pricing evaluates offers via the Decision engine |
| What a customer may use (features, plans, quotas) | **Entitlement (U28)** | Identity permissions are about *actions*; entitlements are about *commercial rights* |
| Financial truth | **Ledger (U30)** | Payment, Marketplace, Subscription post journal entries; nothing else stores balances |
| Review/rating | **Trust & Reputation (U70)** | Product pages query it |
| Notifications of any kind | **Communication (U40)** | other universes emit events + template IDs |
| Files, images, video | **Asset (U43)** | others hold `AssetRef` |
| Approval chains | **Workflow (U60)** + **Governance (U02)** for definition changes | — |
| Rules and thresholds | **Decision (U53)** | no `if` statements on business thresholds inside pack code |
| Catalog vs Product | Product = global truth; Catalog = a tenant's curated assortment | — |
| Marketplace vs Commerce | Commerce = buying flow; Marketplace = multi-sided economics (sellers, commissions, payouts) | — |
| Segments and audiences | **CDP (U85)** | Offer, Pricing, Marketing and Search reference `SegmentRef`. Nobody else computes segments. (A-30) |
| Campaigns and journeys | **Marketing Automation (U86)** | Communication (U40) only delivers messages. Offer (U22) only defines incentives. (A-31) |
| Gift cards, store credit, wallets | **Stored Value (U84)** | Offer references them only as incentives. Ledger keeps the books. (A-29) |
| Commercial entitlements (plans, quotas, seats, licences) | **Entitlement (U28)** | Code calls `Check`/`Consume`. No plan names in code. (A-61) |
| Frames of reference (reality, body, time scale, calendar, monetary, unit and language systems) | **Existence & Reality Frame (U77)** | Geography, Temporal, Currency, Localization and Context consume frames. Earth is a default, not an assumption. (A-23…A-28) |

# PART II — THE META-SYSTEM

## 7. Universal Meta-Model

Everything in UCOS is a **Canonical Object**: definitions (object types, capabilities, policies, workflows, UI views) and instances (orders, products, people) alike. One meta-model lets the platform reason about itself.

### 7.1 Root Canonical Object envelope

Every object, of any type, carries this envelope. Type-specific data lives in `attributes`.

```yaml
# ucos:meta:CanonicalObject  (JSON Schema 2020-12 in the registry)
CanonicalObject:
  id:            UGID            # required, immutable — §7.2
  type:          TypeRef         # e.g. "commerce.order.Order@1.4"
  subtype:       string?         # taxonomy-driven specialisation
  tenant:        TenantRef       # "ucos:tenant:01J..." ; "global" for shared registries
  name:          LocalizedText?
  description:   LocalizedText?
  status:        LifecycleState  # §7.5
  version:       integer         # optimistic-concurrency counter (instances)
  defVersion:    SemVer?         # for definitions only
  owner:         PartyRef        # accountable party (org/person/agent)
  steward:       PartyRef?       # for definitions & registries — required there
  context:       ContextRef      # §7.6 — context in which it was created/valid
  attributes:    object          # validated against the ObjectType schema
  relationships: RelationshipRef[]  # §7.4 (materialised for hot paths; full set in graph)
  policies:      PolicyRef[]     # attached policies (beyond type-level ones)
  classification:                # §19.7 data classification
    confidentiality: public|internal|confidential|restricted
    dataClasses: [PII, PCI, PHI, FINANCIAL, ...]
  compliance:    { jurisdictions: [JurisdictionRef], controls: [ControlRef] }
  temporal:                      # bitemporal — §14.6
    validFrom: TimePoint ; validTo: TimePoint?
    recordedAt: TimePoint ; supersededAt: TimePoint?
  provenance:    { source: SourceRef, method: manual|import|generated|ai, confidence: 0..1 }
  audit:         { createdBy, createdAt: TimePoint, updatedBy, updatedAt: TimePoint, lastAuditRecord: AuditRef }
  evidence:      EvidenceRef[]
  metadata:      { tags: string[], labels: map<string,string>, extensions: object }
```

### 7.2 Universal identity scheme (UGID)

The source listed many identifier families (UID, GID, PID, OID, CID, BID, SID, DID, AID, RID, EID, TID, KID, GPID, GSID). They are unified as **one format with a kind prefix**:

```text
ucos:<kind>:<ULID>                         e.g. ucos:order:01J9Z3K8Q4V6X2...
ucos:<kind>:<namespace>/<natural-key>      e.g. ucos:currency:iso4217/INR   (reference data)
```

| Legacy name | Kind prefix | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| UGID | (all) | the general form |
| UID / PID | `person`, `identity` | Person vs authenticating Identity are separate |
| OID / BID | `org`, `brand` | |
| TID | `tenant` | |
| CID | `customer` → modelled as `party-role` | Customer is a *role* a Party plays, not a separate identity |
| SID | `service` (GSID for global services) | |
| GPID | `gproduct` | Global Product ID (§10) |
| AID | `agent` | AI agent identity |
| DID | `did:` W3C DID (optional) | for verifiable credentials and cross-org trust |
| DeviceID | `device` | |
| EID / KID / RID | `event`, `knowledge`, `resource` | |

Rules: IDs are opaque, immutable and never reused. Natural keys (GTIN, ISBN, VIN, LEI, tax IDs) are stored as `identifiers[]` attributes with a scheme, never as the primary ID. ULIDs give time-ordered, index-friendly keys.

### 7.3 Object Type definition (how new things are modelled without code)

```yaml
# registry: ucos:objecttype:commerce.order.Order@1.4.0
kind: ObjectType
id: commerce.order.Order
version: 1.4.0
universe: U26-order
steward: ucos:org:platform-commerce-team

  buyer:         { type: Reference, target: party.PartyRole, cardinality: "1", constraint: "role == 'buyer'" }
  channel:       { type: Reference, target: experience.Channel, cardinality: "1" }
  lines:         { type: Composition, target: commerce.order.OrderLine, cardinality: "1..N" }

indexes:
  - [tenant, orderNumber]  # unique
  - [tenant, buyer, placedAt]

uiModels: [order.list@1, order.detail@1, order.timeline@1]

### 7.4 Field types, cardinality and relationships

**Canonical field types:** `String, Text, LocalizedText, Number, Integer, Decimal, Boolean, Enumeration (taxonomy-backed), Money, Quantity (value+unit), Percentage, TemporalRef (TimePoint|TimeRange|Duration|Recurrence|TemporalPolicy), Coordinate, GeoShape, Reference, Composition, Array, Object, Map, Binary, AssetRef, Media, Json, Graph, PolicyRef, RuleRef, WorkflowRef, ModelRef, Extension, Computed, Encrypted<T>`.

Types the source called "Date / Time / DateTime / Duration / Currency / Location" are deliberately **not primitive**. They are value types owned by the Temporal, Currency and Geography universes, which enforces Knowledge Once.

**Cardinality:** `1`, `0..1`, `1..N`, `0..N`, plus modifiers `conditional(expr)`, `inherited`, `derived(expr)`, `computed(expr)`, `generated(strategy)`.

**Relationship object:**

```yaml
Relationship:
  id: UGID
  type: RelationshipTypeRef        # from the registry below
  source: ObjectRef                # id + type + version
  target: ObjectRef
  context: ContextRef
  validity: TemporalRef            # TimeRange
  constraints: ExpressionRef[]
  attributes: object               # e.g. quantity, share %, role
  evidence: EvidenceRef[]
  audit: AuditRef
```

**Relationship type registry (seed set, extensible):**

| Category | Types |
|---|---|
| Structural | `contains`, `partOf`, `composedOf`, `aggregates`, `inheritsFrom`, `versionOf`, `supersedes`, `replaces`, `equivalentTo (sameAs)`, `similarTo` |
| Ownership & authority | `owns`, `belongsTo`, `memberOf`, `stewardOf`, `authorizes`, `delegatesTo`, `approves`, `certifies`, `governs`, `controls` |
| Dependency | `dependsOn`, `requires`, `provides`, `consumes`, `produces`, `extends`, `conflictsWith`, `references` |
| Operational | `executes`, `monitors`, `observes`, `evaluates`, `validates`, `verifies`, `audits`, `learnsFrom` |
| Commercial | `sells`, `purchases`, `offers`, `ships`, `settles`, `books`, `schedules`, `subscribesTo`, `reviews`, `rates`, `supports`, `fulfills` |
| Social | `communicatesWith`, `collaboratesWith`, `follows`, `refers` |

Every relationship type declares `domain`, `range`, `inverse`, `cardinality`, `transitive?`, `symmetric?`, and whether it is **materialised** (stored with the object for fast reads) or **graph-only**.

### 7.5 Universal lifecycle

Two lifecycles exist. **Definitions** (types, capabilities, policies, workflows, views, packs) follow the governed lifecycle below. **Instances** (orders, products…) follow their own type-specific state machines (§16).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Proposed
  Proposed --> Draft: accepted for work
  Draft --> Validated: automated validation passes
  Validated --> Draft: changes requested
  Validated --> Approved: authority approves
  Approved --> Certified: certification gates pass
  Certified --> Published: registered & discoverable
  Published --> Operational: activated in ≥1 blueprint
  Operational --> Monitored: (continuous)
  Monitored --> Operational
  Operational --> Evolved: new version published
  Operational --> Deprecated: sunset announced
  Deprecated --> Retired: no active consumers
  Retired --> Archived
  Archived --> [*]
  Draft --> Rejected
  Rejected --> [*]
```

Transition guards (examples):
- `Validated → Approved` requires an `Approval` from an authority whose scope covers the definition's universe (§18).
- `Approved → Certified` requires every applicable `CertificationGate` (§28.2) to be green.
- `Deprecated → Retired` requires `activeConsumers == 0` (computed from the graph) or a forced migration (§29.4).

### 7.6 Context model

Every request, event, workflow step and AI call carries a **ContextEnvelope**. Context is resolved once at the edge and propagated (W3C Baggage + signed header `ucos-context`).

```yaml
ContextEnvelope:
  tenant: TenantRef
  platformInstance: BlueprintRef      # which certified blueprint is executing
  actor:  { identity: IdentityRef, kind: human|service|agent|device, onBehalfOf: IdentityRef? }
  roles: RoleRef[]
  organization: OrgRef?
  jurisdiction:                       # role-keyed map (A-08); consumers declare which role decides
    { actor: [JurisdictionRef], buyer-delivery: [..], seller: [..], data-storage: [..], store: [..], payment-acquirer: [..] }
  locale: LocaleRef                   # language + region formats
  currency: CurrencyRef
  timezone: TZRef
  time: { now: TimePoint, asOf: TimePoint? }   # asOf enables time-travel queries & simulation
  channel: ChannelRef                 # web, ios, android, pos, voice, agent, api...
  device: { id, trust: low|medium|high, fingerprintRisk }
  geo: { coordinate?, place? }
  risk: { score: 0..100 | null, band: low|medium|high|unknown, signals: [] }   # Phase 1: unknown (treated as medium)
  consent: ConsentSnapshotRef
  frame: { reality, body, spatialFrame, timeScale, calendarSystem, sideEffectPolicy }   # U77 (A-27); default ucos:frame:earth-physical
  simulation: boolean                 # derived: frame.reality.kind ∈ {simulated, hypothetical} → no external side effects (§29.6)
  purpose: PurposeRef?                # narrowing only (CTX-L2), e.g. customer-support
  trace: { traceId, spanId }
```

**Context dimensions** (consolidated from all versions): Identity, Organizational, Tenant, Temporal, Spatial/Geographic, Jurisdictional/Regulatory, Linguistic, Cultural, Economic/Financial, Commercial/Marketplace, Channel/Device, Security, Risk, Behavioral, Operational, Environmental, Knowledge, AI, Observer, Reality (physical/digital/simulated), Hypothetical/Simulation.

Dimensions that need no runtime fields (Cultural, Observer, Reality) are resolved through `ContextRule`s. For example, `if locale=ar-* then layoutDirection=rtl`, or `if simulation=true then reality=simulated`.

### 7.7 Traceability model

Every artifact MUST be reachable in the graph along this chain (the "Graph of Everything"):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  C[Constitution] --> L[Law] --> P[Policy] --> CAP[Capability] --> R[Requirement] --> D[Design/Definition]
  D --> I[Implementation/Pack] --> T[Test] --> E[Evidence] --> CERT[Certification] --> DEP[Deployment] --> O[Operation] --> A[Audit]
```

`ucos trace <id>` returns the full chain. A missing link is reported as a Gap of kind `TRACEABILITY` (§11.6).

---

## 8. Capability Genome & Capability Pack Specification

### 8.1 The genome

Every capability follows one structure. This solves the gap the source repeatedly called "the biggest missing artifact", the **Universal Capability Ontology**:

```

- Packs are built into an **OCI artifact**, then signed with Sigstore/cosign. Each carries an SBOM (CycloneDX) and SLSA level-3 provenance.
- Pack runtime: a containerised service implementing the **Pack Runtime Contract** (§13.4), or a WASM module for lightweight extension points (validators, computed fields). WASM is strongly sandboxed.
- Publishing a pack requires certification (§28) and registers it in the Capability Registry and the Knowledge Graph.
- **Capability kinds (A-13):** `abstract` (port only), `core`, `adapter` (implements a port for a provider), `simulator` (contract-faithful stand-in, required for every external-I/O port), `extension` (WASM, extension points only), `ui-pack`, `data-pack` (reference/regime/compliance content), `industry-pack`. Each manifest also declares `scope`: `platform` (always present control-plane or global service) or `tenant` (composed into blueprints). The formal gRPC `PackRuntime` contract is in U57 §5.1, and the SDK in `engineering/KERNEL-DESIGN.md` §7.
- **Machine-readable manifests** live in `spec/capabilities/packs/*.yaml` (109 manifests in v1.1), validated by `spec/capabilities/capability-manifest.schema.json` and `tools/ucos_check.py`.

### 8.4 Dependency semantics

| Keyword | Meaning | Resolver behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `requires` | Hard dependency with a SemVer range | Pull into the closure. If unsatisfiable → `MANDATORY` gap. |
| `optional` | Unlocks listed features when present | Not pulled automatically. Suggested if the PD intent mentions an enabled feature. |
| `conflicts` | Cannot coexist | Conflict gap; the builder must choose. |
| `provides` | Object types/commands/events this pack is the **sole** owner of | Collision with another pack → publish rejected (L4). |
| `extensionPoints` | Typed slots others may fill | Contributions are validated against the contract. |
| `implements` (interface) | Pack implements an abstract capability, e.g. `payment.provider` | Several implementations may coexist (adapters). Context selects one at runtime (e.g. country → PSP). |

**Abstract vs concrete capabilities:** `payment.provider` is abstract; `payment.provider.stripe`, `payment.provider.razorpay` and `payment.provider.adyen` implement it. The Composition Substrate chooses implementations from context rules. For example, `jurisdiction=IN ∧ method=UPI → razorpay|payu`. That is how "no payment gateway is hard-coded" is achieved.

### 8.5 Capability Registry & Marketplace

The Capability Marketplace (Layer 005 of the source) is the Capability Registry plus a storefront:
- **Discovery:** search by outcome, industry, object type, compliance coverage, maturity, rating, cost.
- **Packaging:** packs, plus **Capability Bundles**, which are curated sets such as "Marketplace Starter" or "Subscription Media".
- **Licensing & billing:** each pack can declare a price model (free, per-tenant, usage-based, revenue-share). This is metered by the Entitlement and Ledger universes, so third-party pack vendors can be paid.
- **Trust:** publisher verification, certification badge, security score, runtime health and adoption.
- **Governance:** pack-level policies, allowed-publisher lists per tenant, and kill-switch (revocation propagates to all cells within a defined SLA).

## 9. Universal Temporal Universe

The chat elevated Temporal to a **top-tier constitutional universe** and did not leave it as a Calendar feature. This section is its build specification. **Every** universe that deals with time consumes it.

### 9.1 Canonical temporal objects

| Object | Definition | Representation |
|---|---|---|
| **TimePoint** | An instant | RFC 3339 UTC + original TZ: `{ "utc": "2026-10-01T06:30:00Z", "tz": "Asia/Kolkata" }` |
| **LocalDateTime** | Wall-clock time without an instant (e.g. "store opens 10:00") | `{ "local": "10:00", "tz": "Asia/Kolkata" }` resolved per date |
| **LocalDate / LocalTime / LocalTimeWindow** | Calendar date, wall time, daily window (A-03) | `"2026-10-02"`, `"10:00"`, `{ start: "10:00", end: "22:00" }` (end < start crosses midnight) |
| **BusinessDuration** | Duration counted only in a named calendar's working time (A-03) | `{ value: "P2D", calendar: "ucos:cal:in-business" }` |
| **TimeRange** | Interval `[start, end)` | `{ start: TimePoint, end: TimePoint? }` (open-ended allowed) |
| **Duration** | Length of time | ISO 8601 `PT2H`, `P3D`, `P2M`, plus business-time variants `{ value: "P2D", calendar: "ucos:cal:in-business" }` |
| **Recurrence** | Repeating pattern | RFC 5545 RRULE + EXDATE + calendar binding: `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA,SU` |
| **Calendar** | Named set of working/non-working periods | Types: Gregorian, Fiscal (4-4-5, custom FY), Holiday (country/region/tenant), Business-hours, Resource, Settlement, Trading session |
| **AvailabilityWindow** | When a resource/offer/store can be used | `Recurrence × TimeRange × Calendar × Capacity` |
| **Slot** | A bookable unit derived from availability | `{ resource, range: TimeRange, capacity, remaining }` |
| **Reservation** | A claim on slot capacity | `{ slot, holder, status: held|confirmed|released, holdExpires }` |
| **SLAClock** | Elapsed business time against a target, with pauses | `{ target: Duration, calendar, pausedOn: [states], breachAt }` |
| **Trigger** | A temporal or hybrid condition that fires an event | §9.3 |
| **Timeline** | Ordered events of an object (past, present, scheduled future) | Projection over events and schedules |
| **TemporalPolicy** | **Reusable** bundle of validity + recurrence + windows + timezone + calendar | §9.2 |
| **Forecast** | Predicted temporal series | Produced by the Forecasting engine, stored as time-series |
| **SLADefinition / Schedule** | SLA template; named group of triggers with one lifecycle (A-03) | U13 §3.8, §3.10a |
| **Waitlist / QueueToken** | Ordered demand when capacity is full; walk-in and virtual queues (A-45) | U13 Appendix E |
| **CalendarFeed / ExternalCalendarLink / Invitation / Reminder** | ICS publishing; Google, Microsoft and CalDAV sync; invites; relative reminders (A-45) | U13 Appendix E |

**Frame-aware time (A-24):** `TimePoint` may carry a time `scale` (UTC by default; TAI, Mars MTC, Lunar LTC, world or simulation clocks). Calendars belong to a calendar system (Gregorian by default; Hijri, Vikram Samvat, Mars sol-based…). See U77.
**Naming rule (A-45, A-47):** field names carry their Temporal type. `*At`, `expires*`, `deadline` and `validUntil` are TimePoints; `validity`, `period` and `term` are TimeRanges; `window` is a TemporalPolicy; `ttl` and `timeout` are Durations; `schedule` is a Recurrence. These names are reserved for time fields. `TEMPORAL-BINDING-MATRIX.md` binds every universe's time needs (U01–U109) to these mechanisms, and gate `ARCH-TMP-05` enforces it.

### 9.2 TemporalPolicy (Knowledge Once in practice)

**Never** model `offer.start_date/end_date`, `coupon.start_date/end_date`, `subscription.start_date/end_date` or `booking.start_date/end_date` independently.

```yaml
kind: TemporalPolicy
id: ucos:tmp:TMP-001
name: "Weekend Evening Window — India"
tenant: ucos:tenant:acme
validity:   { start: "2026-01-01T00:00:00+05:30", end: "2026-12-31T23:59:59+05:30" }
recurrence: "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA,SU"
window:     { local: "10:00-22:00" }
timezone:   Asia/Kolkata
calendar:   { include: [], exclude: [ucos:cal:in-national-holidays-2026] }
blackouts:  [ { start: "2026-11-01", end: "2026-11-03" } ]   # Diwali stock freeze
precedence: 100
```

The same policy is referenced by 100 offers, 50 campaigns, 20 coupons, loyalty multipliers, seller incentives and marketplace promotions:

```yaml
kind: Offer
id: ucos:offer:01J...
type: percentage-discount
temporalPolicy: ucos:tmp:TMP-001          # ← reference, not dates
eligibilityPolicy: ucos:pol:new-buyers
pricingPolicy: { percent: 15, cap: { amount: "500.00", currency: INR } }
governancePolicy: ucos:pol:marketing-approval-required
```

### 9.3 Trigger Engine

| Trigger kind | Example | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Time | "At 10:00 Asia/Kolkata daily" | Durable timer (scheduler shards) |
| Recurrence | "Every Monday", "Every month end", "Every festival (holiday calendar tag)" | RRULE expansion, materialised in a 90-day rolling horizon |
| Relative | "2 hours after payment", "3 days before expiry" | Event-anchored timer: `anchor: payment.payment.captured, offset: PT2H` |
| Inactivity | "Cart idle 2h" | Timer reset on matching events |
| Event | "After shipment" | Event subscription |
| Condition | "If inventory < 10", "If risk score > 90" | Continuous query on a stream (stateful stream processor) |
| Hybrid | "If SLA breached during business hours" | Composition of the above via Decision engine |
| Geo-temporal | "When driver enters geofence between 18:00–22:00" | Geo stream + window |
| Policy/Compliance | "Retention period elapsed", "Certificate expires in 30 days" | Temporal facts on objects |
| AI | "When forecast demand exceeds capacity" | Forecast series + condition trigger |

Triggers are **data**: `Trigger { kind, spec, target: (event | command | workflowSignal), idempotencyKey, misfirePolicy: fire-once|skip|catch-up, owner }`.

Guarantees: at-least-once delivery with idempotency keys; misfire handling defined per trigger; clock source is cell-synchronised NTP/PTP with monotonic guards; DST transitions follow the IANA tz database rules (a nonexistent local time shifts forward, an ambiguous one uses the first occurrence unless specified).

### 9.4 Temporal consumers (binding map)

| Domain | Uses |
|---|---|
| Commerce/Offer | offer validity, flash sales (10:00–11:00 every Friday), coupon expiry, campaign schedules, price-change effective dates, inventory allocation windows |
| Subscription/Billing | renewal recurrence, billing cycles, proration (Duration math), grace periods, dunning schedules |
| Logistics | pickup windows, delivery slots, transit durations, cut-off times, driver shifts, route schedules |
| Marketplace | seller onboarding windows, auction/bid periods, settlement periods (T+N on settlement calendar) |
| Finance | interest accrual (day-count conventions), EMI schedules, trading sessions, fiscal periods, period close |
| ERP/HRMS | payroll cycles, attendance, leave, shifts, production schedules |
| CRM/Support | follow-ups, reminders, SLA clocks, escalation timelines |
| AI | training windows, retraining cadence, feature freshness |
| Security | credential, session, token and certificate expiry; key rotation schedules |
| Compliance | retention periods, filing deadlines, audit periods |

> **Complete binding:** `constitutions/TEMPORAL-BINDING-MATRIX.md` lists, for all 100 universes, every time need and the Temporal mechanism it must use. `constitutions/U13-temporal/constitution.md` Appendix E adds calendar feeds and sync, invitations, multi-party availability, waitlists, queue tokens, reminders and time off.

### 9.5 Universal Calendar Product (generated from Temporal)

A Calendar capability (`temporal.calendar`) renders any calendar-typed object: personal (with Google/Outlook sync connectors), resource (rooms, vehicles, machines), commerce (sales, offers, campaigns), logistics (delivery/pickup), workforce (shifts, attendance), manufacturing (production), financial (fiscal, settlement), AI (training). It provides the views `calendar.month|week|day|agenda|timeline|resource-grid` (see wireframe W10).

### 9.6 Temporal governance, simulation and twin

- **Governance:** timezone database version pinned per release; holiday calendars have stewards per country and are versioned; fiscal calendars are approved by Finance authority.
- **Simulation:** `ContextEnvelope.time.asOf` lets any decision, price or availability be evaluated "as of" a past or future time. Scenarios such as "what if a 20% discount runs every weekend in Q4" run against the Simulation universe (§29.6).
- **Temporal twin questions:** what happened (event store), what is happening (live state), what will happen (schedules), what could happen (simulation), what should happen (optimisation).

## 10. Global Product & Service Intelligence Network

The chat asked for "every product and service in existence available for reuse". It is built as a **knowledge network** with provenance, not as a static catalog.

### 10.1 Master vs tenant separation

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Global[Global Registries — tenant: global]
    GP[GlobalProduct<br/>GPID]
    GS[GlobalService<br/>GSID]
    ATT[Attribute Registry<br/>units, value types]
    TAX[Taxonomy Registry<br/>UCOS + GS1 GPC + UNSPSC + Google]
    BR[Brand / Manufacturer]
    REGL[Regulatory facts<br/>HS codes, hazmat, age limits]
  end
  subgraph TenantA[Tenant A — Amazon-like]
    LA[Listing: GPID + price + stock + seller copy]
  end
  subgraph TenantB[Tenant B — B2B distributor]
    LB[Listing: GPID + tiered pricing + MOQ]
  end
  subgraph TenantC[Tenant C — POS retailer]
    LC[Listing: GPID + store price]
  end
  GP --> LA & LB & LC
  TAX --> GP
  ATT --> GP
  BR --> GP
  REGL --> GP
```

Example: **"Apple iPhone 17, 256 GB, Black"** exists **once** as `ucos:gproduct:01J…` with GTINs, specs, compliance facts and media rights. An Amazon-like store, a Flipkart-like store, a B2B marketplace, an ERP, a POS, a WMS, analytics, the recommendation engine and AI agents all reference that GPID. Tenant-specific facts (price, stock, seller description, warranty terms) live in tenant **Listings**.

### 10.2 Global product model

```yaml
GlobalProduct:
  id: ucos:gproduct:01J...
  identifiers: [ {scheme: GTIN-13, value: "0195949xxxxxx"}, {scheme: MPN, value: "MYxx3HN/A"} ]
  brand: ucos:brand:apple
  manufacturer: ucos:org:apple-inc
  productModel: ucos:gproductmodel:iphone-17        # family/model level
  variantAxes: [storage, color]
  variantValues: { storage: {value: 256, unit: GB}, color: ucos:color:black }
  classification:
    ucos: ucos:tax:electronics/phones/smartphones
    gs1-gpc: "10008047"
    unspsc: "43191501"
    hs: "8517.13"
  attributes:                              # each key is a registered Attribute
    display.diagonal: { value: 6.3, unit: in }
    battery.capacity: { value: 3600, unit: mAh }
    connectivity.5g: true
  regulatory: { batteryHazmat: UN3481, eWasteCategory: "...", minAge: null }
  media: [ucos:asset:...]                  # with rights metadata
  provenance: { sources: [manufacturer-feed, gs1-registry, tenant-contribution], confidence: 0.97 }
  lifecycle: { status: Published, launchedOn: TemporalRef }
```

**Services** follow the same pattern (`GlobalService` with `GSID`): consulting, transport, healthcare, education, streaming, banking, telecom, legal, repair, AI services, robot services. Each has a delivery model (on-site, remote, hybrid, async), SLA templates, scheduling requirements (Temporal) and capacity semantics (Resource).

**Attribute Registry:** every attribute has an id, value type, unit dimension (length, mass, power, data size, currency, rate…), allowed values (taxonomy-backed enumerations), localisation and validation. Physical, digital, financial, behavioural, operational and regulatory attribute families exist. New attributes are added as data.

**Product natures and regulated goods (A-29, A-56):** a product-nature registry covers 21 natures: physical durable and consumable, perishable/cold-chain, living, bulk commodity, energy, water, real property, vehicle, digital download, licence and streaming right, data product, IP licence, environmental credit, rights/permits/spectrum, financial instrument (U100 only), virtual item (U77), tokenised asset (U99), labour time, admission, gift value and service plan. A `RegulatedGoodsProfile` (25 categories, per jurisdiction) is enforced at catalogue, checkout, fulfilment, tax, customs and search. Product relationships (accessories, spare parts, compatibility/fitment, successors), product documents (SDS, certificates, manuals) and lifecycle facts are in U18 Appendices D and E. Configurable products, installed base, warranty, rental, ticketing and stored value have their own universes (U78–U84).

### 10.3 Ingestion & enrichment pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S1[Manufacturer feeds] --> I
  S2[GS1 / registries] --> I
  S3[Tenant uploads<br/>CSV, API, connectors] --> I
  S4[Licensed data providers] --> I
  I[Ingest & stage] --> N[Normalise<br/>units, encodings, attributes]
  N --> M[Match<br/>identifier → fuzzy → embedding]
  M --> D{Duplicate?}
  D -- yes --> MERGE[Merge with survivorship rules<br/>+ provenance]
  D -- no --> NEW[Create candidate GPID]
  MERGE & NEW --> E[Enrich<br/>AI classification, attribute extraction,<br/>translation, image tagging]
  E --> V[Validate<br/>schema, regulatory facts, quality score]
  V --> Q{Quality ≥ threshold?}
  Q -- yes --> P[Publish to Global Registry]
  Q -- no --> R[Steward review queue<br/>W9]
  R --> P
  P --> G[(Knowledge Graph + Search + Vector)]
```

- **Survivorship rules** (data, per attribute): `manufacturer > gs1 > licensed > tenant > ai`, overridable by a steward.
- **Quality score:** completeness, consistency, freshness, source trust, conflict count.
- **AI enrichment** is always flagged `provenance.method=ai` with a confidence value. Facts below the confidence threshold are never auto-published.
- **Legal:** a crawled or licensed source carries a licence and usage rights. The registry enforces rights on redistribution to tenants. "Auto crawl" is allowed only for sources whose terms permit it.

### 10.4 Commercial intelligence (attached, not merged)

Pricing intelligence (market price ranges), demand signals and competitor observations are separate `KnowledgeObject`s linked to GPIDs. They carry their own provenance and trust score, and are aggregated across tenants **only** with consent and k-anonymity thresholds (§20.5).

### 10.5 Industry & template registry

Industry templates bundle a taxonomy subset, attribute sets, typical capability bundles, workflows, compliance packs and UI templates. Starter templates: Retail, Grocery, Fashion, Electronics, Pharmacy, Restaurants/Food delivery, Mobility, Hospitality, Travel, Healthcare clinic, Education/LMS, Media/OTT, Fintech-brokerage, B2B distribution, Manufacturing, Government services. Using a template pre-fills a Platform Definition (§11.2).

## 11. Universal Composition Substrate

The chat identified this as **"the constitutional core"** and "the most critical missing document". It is the engine that answers, *without hard-coding*:

> Given Industry = Commerce, Countries = 40, Channels = Web + Mobile, Capabilities = Marketplace + Logistics + Payments, which entities, workflows, APIs, databases, UI, tests, security controls, compliance controls and AI agents must exist, and which are missing?

```

### 11.3 Derivation rules ("how the platform knows")

Required items are derived by **rules stored as data** in the Rule Registry. These are Datalog-style facts and rules evaluated over the Knowledge Graph. Adding a new country, regulation or capability means adding facts or rules. **The composer itself never changes.**

```prolog
% Facts (registry data)
jurisdiction_of(country:IN, jur:IN).            
regulation_applies(reg:DPDP-2023, jur:IN).
regulation_applies(reg:RBI-PA-Guidelines, jur:IN) :- capability(payment.core).
regulation_applies(reg:UAE-PDPL, jur:AE).
data_class(payment.core, PCI).
data_class(identity.core, PII).
requires_control(reg:DPDP-2023, ctrl:consent-notice).
requires_control(reg:DPDP-2023, ctrl:dsr-access-erasure).
control_implemented_by(ctrl:consent-notice, privacy.consent).
control_implemented_by(ctrl:dsr-access-erasure, privacy.dsr).
adapter_for(payment.provider, jur:IN, method:UPI, payment.provider.razorpay).
adapter_for(tax.determination, jur:IN, tax.gst-india).
adapter_for(tax.determination, jur:AE, tax.vat-uae).
residency_required(jur:IN, data_class:PCI, payment-data-localisation).

% Rules (generic — never change for new countries)
required_capability(C) :- requested(C).
required_capability(D) :- required_capability(C), requires(C, D).
required_capability(Impl) :- required_capability(Abs), abstract(Abs), in_scope(J), adapter_for(Abs, J, Impl).
required_capability(Impl) :- in_scope(J), regulation_applies(R, J), requires_control(R, Ctrl),
                             control_implemented_by(Ctrl, Impl).
gap(missing_capability, C) :- required_capability(C), not available(C).
gap(uncertified, C)       :- required_capability(C), available(C), not certified(C).
gap(conflict, C1, C2)     :- required_capability(C1), required_capability(C2), conflicts(C1, C2).
gap(residency, Cell, J)   :- assigned_cell(Cell, J), residency_required(J, _, _), not cell_in(Cell, J).
```

Reference engine: a Datalog evaluator (e.g. Soufflé or a Rust Datalog crate embedded in the composer) over a snapshot of the graph. The **ResolutionTrace** records which rule produced each requirement. This powers the "**Why is this here?**" explanation in the UI (wireframe W5).

**v1.1 (A-60, A-62, A-66): facts as data.** Applicability facts live in `spec/rules/facts/{regulations,controls,defaults}.yaml`, and the generic rules in `spec/rules/core/closure.dl`. The base capability set (identity, org, party, geo, temporal, currency, l10n, context, entitlement, decision, workflow, integration, api, ui, tenant admin, observability, privacy ×3, compliance, and **communication core + in-app + inbound**) is data in `defaults.yaml`. So are channel requirements (web, push, WhatsApp, live chat, voice, video, social messengers) and default payment methods per country. `tools/ucos_check.py` runs the reference semantics over three reference platform definitions (D2C India+UAE, B2B India, omnichannel India). Each composes with **0 gaps**, deterministically.

### 11.5 Conflict & overlap detection

| Check | Example | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership collision | Two packs both `provide` `Coupon` | Publish-time rejection (L4) |
| Capability conflict | `inventory.single-location` vs `inventory.multi-node` | Builder chooses; resolver suggests based on scale |
| Policy conflict | Allow and deny on the same action/resource with equal precedence | Policy analyser (Cedar validator / SMT) flags it; precedence must be set |
| Temporal conflict | Two TemporalPolicies on one offer with overlapping windows and different discounts | Decision table hit-policy must be declared |
| Compliance conflict | Data-retention minimum (tax law: 8 years) vs erasure request (privacy law) | Rule: legal hold overrides erasure; the record is minimised, not deleted (encoded as a control precedence) |
| Residency conflict | Cell placement violates residency | Resolver places the tenant shard in a compliant cell, or emits a gap |
| SoD violation | Same role can create a payout and approve it | Gap `SOD` with suggested role split |

### 11.6 Gap discovery: taxonomy, severity and report

**Gap kinds** (consolidating every "Missing X Detection" list in the source): `CAPABILITY, DOMAIN, OBJECT, RELATIONSHIP, WORKFLOW, DECISION, POLICY, SECURITY_CONTROL, COMPLIANCE_CONTROL, DATA (contract/retention/residency), INTEGRATION, API, UI (view/journey/locale/a11y), AI (guardrail/eval), TEST, DOCUMENTATION, OBSERVABILITY (signal/SLO/alert/runbook), RESILIENCE (backup/DR), INFRASTRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE (steward/approver), CERTIFICATION, TRACEABILITY, FAILURE_SCENARIO, USER_JOURNEY, PERFORMANCE, SCALABILITY, COST`.

**Discovery kinds (A-18):** `DUPLICATION, OVERLAP, CONFLICT, OBSOLESCENCE, UNUSED, UNDERPERFORMANCE, OPPORTUNITY`, plus `PHASE_NOT_AVAILABLE`, `MISSING_ADAPTER`, `MISSING_SIMULATOR`, `CONTROL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` and `EVENT_WITHOUT_PRODUCER_IN_BLUEPRINT` (emitted by the checker).

**Severity:** `MANDATORY` (blocks activation), `RECOMMENDED` (blocks certification unless waived), `OPTIONAL` (advisory), `INSIGHT` (discovery output that feeds Evolution only; A-18). Fixes are first-class catalogue objects (`fix.add-capability`, `fix.choose-implementation`, `fix.split-role`, …), each with an effort type and a preview diff (U75 §3.3).

```json
{
  "kind": "GapReport",
  "blueprintCandidate": "ucos:pd:bazaar-marketplace@1.0.0",
  "summary": { "mandatory": 3, "recommended": 7, "optional": 12 },
  "gaps": [
    {
      "id": "GAP-0001",
      "kind": "COMPLIANCE_CONTROL",

      "fixes": [
        { "action": "add-capability", "target": "payment.tokenization.network", "effort": "config" },
        { "action": "assign-cell", "target": "cell-in-mum-1", "effort": "config" }
      ],
      "authorityToWaive": "none"
    },
    {
      "id": "GAP-0004",
      "kind": "UI",

    },
    {
      "id": "GAP-0009",
      "kind": "OBSERVABILITY",
      "severity": "RECOMMENDED",
      "title": "No SLO alert route for payout.cycle workflow",
      "fixes": [ { "action": "apply-default-alert-policy", "effort": "config" } ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Activation rule (L10):** `activate(blueprint) ⇔ mandatory = 0 ∧ ∀ recommended: (resolved ∨ waived_by_authority ∧ waiver.expiry > now) ∧ certification.status = PASSED`.

### 11.7 Composer properties

- **Pure and deterministic** (L18): `compose(PD, snapshot, composerVersion) → blueprint` is a pure function, hence cacheable and reproducible.
- **Explainable:** every element of the blueprint links to the rule(s) and input(s) that caused it.
- **Incremental:** a PD diff recomposes only the affected subgraph. The Studio shows a blueprint diff before apply (W5).
- **Simulatable:** a blueprint can be activated in a **simulation cell**, where external adapters are replaced by contract-faithful simulators.

## 12. Generation Engine & Platform Factory

### 12.1 Key architectural decision: interpret first, generate second (ADR-001)

The source asked for UI, API, DB, workflow, infra and test generation. There are two strategies:

| Strategy | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Generate code per tenant** | Familiar output; tenants can "eject" | N tenants × M versions of code to patch and secure; drift; slow rollout; violates L6 and L2 in practice |
| **Interpret metadata at runtime** (metadata-driven multi-tenant runtime, like Salesforce/ServiceNow) | One codebase to secure and scale; instant config changes; tenant changes are data | Runtime engines must be excellent; performance work goes into the engines |

**Decision:** UCOS **interprets** blueprints at runtime for data, API, workflow, policy, decision and UI. It **generates** only artifacts that are consumed *outside* the runtime or that benefit from static compilation:

| Generated artifact | Generator | Consumer |
|---|---|---|
| Client SDKs (TS, Kotlin, Swift, Python, Go) | OpenAPI/GraphQL → SDK generator | tenant developers, mobile apps |
| API reference & developer portal | spec → docs | developers |
| User/admin manuals, runbooks | capability docs + blueprint → doc generator (with AI drafting + human review) | users, SRE |
| Physical DB migrations for core object types | schema diff → SQL migration | data plane |
| Mobile app shells (white-label) | blueprint + theme → React Native/Expo build config | app stores |
| Infrastructure-as-code for cells | blueprint infra section → OpenTofu/Crossplane claims | GitOps |
| Test suites (contract, scenario, load, a11y) | blueprint → test generator | CI / certification |
| Dashboards & alert rules | signals → Grafana/alert manifests | ops |
| Compliance evidence packs, SBOM | evidence + SBOM → reports | auditors |
| Diagrams (C4, ERD, flows) | graph → Mermaid/Structurizr | everyone |

### 12.2 Generator contract

```yaml
kind: Generator
id: gen.sdk.typescript
version: 2.1.0
input:  [Blueprint.api, Blueprint.objectTypes]
output: { kind: npm-package, path: generated/sdk/ts }
deterministic: true                 # same input → byte-identical output (hash recorded)
templates: templates/sdk-ts/        # Handlebars/Jinja; no AI in deterministic generators
validation: [tsc --noEmit, contract-tests]
```

AI-assisted generators (documentation drafting, translations, test-idea generation) are marked `deterministic: false`. Their output is always a **proposal** that goes through review and certification. It is never activated directly.

### 12.4 Builder Studio (no-code builders)

Tenant/Company/Marketplace builder · Product & Service builder · Commerce-model builder · Object Designer · Workflow Designer · Decision Table editor · Temporal Policy editor · Policy editor · UI/Journey designer · Theme/brand designer · Integration/mapping builder · AI agent builder · Analytics/report builder · Compliance profile builder · Operations builder (SLOs, alerts) · Governance builder (authorities, approval chains).

Every builder writes **definitions** (canonical objects in Draft). It never writes code.

### 12.5 Specification repository generation (the "Genesis" process)

The Master Genesis Directive asked for 50 artifacts per universe across ~72 universes. That corpus is produced **incrementally, universe by universe**, from this document, using the repository layout in §31.3:

```text
Constitution (this doc) → Universe constitution → Ontology → Taxonomy → Object types → Schemas
→ Relationships → Events → Commands/APIs → Workflows → Decisions → Policies → Controls
→ UI models → Tests → Docs → Certification criteria
```

The per-universe template (the 50 sections from the Genesis Directive) is consolidated into **12 required sections**, with no loss of content:

| # | Section | Covers Genesis items |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Constitution, authority, principles, laws | 1–4 |
| 2 | Ontology & taxonomy | 5–6 |
| 3 | Registry model & canonical objects/schemas/relationships | 7–10 |
| 4 | Events, APIs, service & runtime contracts | 11–12, 21–22 |
| 5 | Workflows, state machines, rules | 13–14, 16 |
| 6 | Policies, security, encryption, audit, compliance | 15, 17–20 |
| 7 | Validation, certification, versioning, dependency, reuse rules | 23–24, 26–28 |
| 8 | Discovery, gap detection, self-healing, evolution rules | 25, 29–31 |
| 9 | AI & agent governance | 32–33 |
| 10 | Twin, analytics, reporting, monitoring, operations | 34–38 |
| 11 | UI, UX, accessibility, localisation | 39–42 |
| 12 | Scalability, performance, DR, HA, multi-tenant/region/cloud | 43–50 |

# PART III — RUNTIME & DATA

## 13. Runtime Fabric

### 13.1 Engines (one execution fabric, generic engines)

| Engine | Responsibility | Reference implementation (§31.1) |

  B-->>G: 200 {cart}
  G-->>C: 200 + ETag: "8"
  O-->>O: relay outbox → commerce.cart.line-added
```

### 13.3 Transaction, consistency and concurrency model

| Concern | Rule |
|---|---|
| Transaction boundary | One **aggregate** per transaction (e.g. Cart, Order, LedgerJournal). ACID inside it (Postgres). |
| Cross-aggregate / cross-capability | **Sagas** in the workflow engine, with compensating commands (e.g. `ReleaseStockReservation`). |
| Event publication | **Transactional outbox** → relay → event bus. No dual writes. |
| Concurrency | Optimistic locking (`version`), `If-Match` ETags on APIs; pessimistic `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` only inside short command handlers. |
| Idempotency | `Idempotency-Key` required on all non-GET commands; stored 24h–30d per command type; same key + different payload → 409. |
| Read models | Eventually consistent projections (target lag p99 < 2s); read-your-writes supported via `X-Consistency: strong` for the owning aggregate. |
| Money | Decimal strings, banker's rounding only where regulation says; ledger is double-entry and immutable; corrections are reversing entries. |
| Ordering | Per-aggregate ordering via event-bus partition key = aggregate id. |
| Exactly-once effects | At-least-once delivery + idempotent consumers (consumer offset + processed-event table). |

### 13.4 Pack Runtime Contract

Each pack service MUST:
1. Expose `/.well-known/ucos/pack` (manifest hash, version, health, readiness).
2. Accept commands via gRPC `ucos.pack.v1.CommandHandler/Handle(CommandEnvelope) → ResultEnvelope`.
3. Accept events via subscription on the bus with the standard consumer library (idempotency, retries, DLQ).
4. Use **only** the platform SDK for DB access, so that tenancy/RLS, encryption, auditing and outbox are enforced automatically.
5. Emit OTel traces/metrics/logs with standard attributes (`ucos.tenant`, `ucos.capability`, `ucos.command`).
6. Never call another pack's database. It calls commands/queries or consumes events only.
7. Run with a non-root, read-only filesystem, network policy limited to declared ports and adapters, and secrets via workload identity.
8. (v1.1) Have **no direct internet egress**. All external I/O goes through the U62 connector runtime and egress gateway (INT-L1). Every external-I/O port has a simulator (INT-L5).

### 13.5 Multi-tenancy model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Cell[Cell = region + full data-plane stack]
    direction TB
    subgraph Pooled[Pooled tier]
      T1[(Tenant A rows)]:::t
      T2[(Tenant B rows)]:::t
    end
    subgraph Schema[Schema-per-tenant tier]
      S1[(schema tenant_c)]
    end
    subgraph Dedicated[Dedicated tier]
      D1[(DB cluster tenant_d)]
    end
  end
  classDef t fill:#eef
```

| Tier | Isolation | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Pooled | Shared tables + Postgres Row-Level Security on `tenant_id` + per-tenant DEKs | SMB tenants, trials |
| Schema | Dedicated schema, shared cluster | Mid-market, custom indexes |
| Dedicated | Dedicated DB cluster (and optionally dedicated cell) | Enterprise, regulated (banking, health, government), residency |

Tier moves are online migrations orchestrated by the platform (logical replication + cutover). Noisy-neighbour controls: per-tenant rate limits, connection quotas, workload priority classes, and per-tenant Kafka quotas.

## 14. Data Architecture

### 14.1 Polyglot storage mapping

| Data kind | Store | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Transactional canonical objects | PostgreSQL 16+ (Citus or cloud-managed, partitioned) | Core universes: generated physical tables; tenant extensions: `JSONB` + GIN indexes (ADR-003) |
| Ledger | PostgreSQL, append-only tables, hash-chained journals | Separate cluster in regulated tiers |
| Events / streams | Kafka-compatible | Retention per topic; compacted topics for state |
| Search | OpenSearch | Projections from events |
| Vector | pgvector / Qdrant | Embeddings for products, knowledge, support |
| Graph | Neo4j (control-plane UKG); Postgres for tenant relationships | |
| Documents / binaries | S3-compatible object storage | Encrypted, versioned, lifecycle rules |
| Time-series | Prometheus/Mimir (ops); ClickHouse (business series) | |
| Analytics / lakehouse | Apache Iceberg on object storage + Trino/Spark; ClickHouse for real-time | CDC from Postgres via Debezium |
| Cache | Redis (tenant-namespaced keys) | Never the source of truth |
| Audit | Append-only store (Postgres + WORM object storage replica) | Hash chain anchored daily |

### 14.2 Physical modelling of dynamic object types (ADR-003)

- **Core object types** (owned by certified packs) → generated physical tables with typed columns, constraints and indexes. Migrations are produced by the schema-diff generator and are always backward-compatible (expand → migrate → contract).
- **Tenant custom attributes** (`Extension` fields) → `custom JSONB` column validated against the tenant's extension schema. Tenants may request indexes, which the platform creates as expression indexes within quotas.
- **Registry-only types** (reference data, low volume) → generic `objects` table (`type, id, attributes JSONB`).

### 14.3 Residency, sovereignty and cells

- Each cell is pinned to a jurisdiction. A tenant's **data shards** are placed in cells that satisfy `residency_required` rules (§11.3).
- Cross-border flows (e.g. global catalog → tenant cell) carry only non-personal data unless a transfer mechanism (SCCs, adequacy, consent) is recorded as a fact in the Compliance universe.
- Global registries (products, taxonomies, reference data) replicate read-only to all cells.

### 14.4 Data contracts, lineage and quality

```yaml
kind: DataContract
id: dc.order.placed.v3
producer: commerce.order
schema: events/order.placed.v3.json
semantics: "Emitted once per order when payment authorisation succeeded or COD accepted."
sla: { freshnessObjective: "p99 < PT5S", completeness: "100%" }
classification: { dataClasses: [PII, FINANCIAL] }
consumers: [fulfillment.core, ledger.core, analytics.lakehouse, recommendation.basic]
breakingChangePolicy: "new major version; dual-publish for 90 days"
```

Lineage: OpenLineage events from pipelines plus the event-catalog graph give column-level lineage from source to report. Quality: Great-Expectations-style checks are attached to contracts, and failures create `DATA` gaps and alerts.

**Owner (A-41):** data catalogue, data contracts, data products, lineage, quality, master data and governed sharing are owned by **U93 Data Governance & Data Products**. Every persistent dataset must be registered before use (DATA-L1).

### 14.5 Data lifecycle

Classification → retention rule (resolved per jurisdiction × data class × legal hold) → archival (cold storage) → deletion or crypto-shredding (destroy the per-tenant or per-subject DEK). Legal hold suspends deletion. Every deletion produces evidence.

### 14.6 Bitemporal model

Canonical objects record **valid time** (`validFrom/validTo`, when it is true in the world) and **transaction time** (`recordedAt/supersededAt`, when the system knew it). This enables `asOf` queries, regulatory reconstruction ("what did we show the customer on 3 Oct?"), and simulation. It is implemented with history tables (temporal tables pattern) for core types and event replay for the rest.

---

## 15. API & Event Specification

### 15.1 API styles

| Style | Use | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| REST (JSON) | Public/tenant APIs; commands & queries | OpenAPI 3.1 generated from capability manifests |
| GraphQL (federated) | Experience/BFF reads, portals | One subgraph per universe |
| gRPC | Internal service-to-service, pack runtime contract | Protobuf |
| Events | Async integration, projections | AsyncAPI 3 + CloudEvents 1.0 |
| Webhooks | Tenant/external notification | Signed (HMAC-SHA256 + timestamp), retries with backoff |
| MCP | AI agents (internal & external) using platform tools | Tools generated from commands with authority scopes |

### 15.2 REST conventions

```text
Base:            https://{tenant-domain}/api/v1
Resources:       /{universe}/{collection}/{id}
                 /commerce/carts/{cartId}
Commands:        POST /{universe}/{collection}/{id}:{command}
                 POST /commerce/carts/{cartId}:addLine
Queries:         GET  /{universe}/{collection}?filter=...&sort=...&page[cursor]=...&page[size]=50
Generic object:  /objects/{type}/{id}   (any registered type, policy-checked)
Headers:         Authorization: Bearer <JWT> | Idempotency-Key | If-Match | Accept-Language
                 X-UCOS-Context-AsOf (simulation/time-travel, privileged) | traceparent
Versioning:      URL major (/v1); additive changes only within a major; deprecation via Sunset header
Errors:          RFC 9457 application/problem+json
Pagination:      cursor-based; total counts opt-in
Rate limits:     RateLimit-* headers (IETF draft), per tenant × API product × principal
```

Error example:

```json
{
  "type": "https://errors.ucos.io/policy/denied",
  "title": "Action not permitted",
  "status": 403,
  "detail": "Payout approval requires a different approver than the creator (SoD).",

  "ucos": { "code": "POLICY_SOD_VIOLATION", "policy": "marketplace.payout.sod", "traceId": "4bf9..." }
}
```

### 15.3 Generic object API (works for any registered type)

```http
POST /api/v1/objects/healthcare.encounter.Encounter
GET  /api/v1/objects/healthcare.encounter.Encounter/{id}?expand=patient,practitioner
POST /api/v1/objects/{type}:query     { "where": {...}, "select": [...], "asOf": "..." }
GET  /api/v1/meta/types/{type}        # schema, commands, views — enables generic UIs/agents
```

```

### 15.5 Event naming & catalog

- `type = <universe>.<object>.<past-tense-verb>` (kebab-case verbs): `order.order.placed`, `payment.payment-intent.captured`, `temporal.trigger.fired`, `governance.blueprint.activated`.
- Topics: `ucos.<cell>.<universe>.<object>.v<major>`, partition key = aggregate id.
- Every event type is registered (schema, owner, classification, retention, consumers). Unregistered events are rejected by the producer SDK.
- Compatibility: schema registry enforces BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE within a major version.
- **Categories (A-12):** `domain` (business facts), `integration` (curated public facts for webhooks), `system` (definition and lifecycle), `signal` (high-volume telemetry-like, short retention), `audit` (to the audit store only).
- **Claim-check (A-12):** payloads ≤ 64 KB. Larger payloads go to object storage and the event carries a reference.
- Consumers MUST be idempotent (EVT-L6). Replays carry `ucosreplay=true`, and consumers with side effects skip them by default.

### 15.6 Canonical event families (seed)

| Universe | Events |
|---|---|
| Identity | identity.identity.registered, .verified, .suspended; identity.session.started, .ended; identity.role.granted, .revoked |
| Catalog | catalog.listing.created, .published, .unpublished, .updated |
| Offer | offer.offer.created, .activated, .expired, .redeemed |
| Pricing | pricing.pricelist.changed, pricing.price.overridden |
| Cart | commerce.cart.created, .line-added, .line-removed, .coupon-applied, .abandoned, .converted |
| Order | order.order.placed, .confirmed, .cancelled, .amended, .completed; order.return.requested, .approved |
| Payment | payment.payment-intent.created, .authorized, .captured, .failed; payment.refund.issued; payment.dispute.opened |
| Ledger | ledger.journal.posted, ledger.period.closed, ledger.settlement.completed |
| Inventory | inventory.stock.adjusted, .reserved, .released, .depleted |
| Fulfillment | fulfillment.shipment.created, .dispatched, .delivered, .failed |
| Temporal | temporal.trigger.fired, temporal.reservation.held, .confirmed, .expired; temporal.sla.breached |
| Governance | governance.proposal.submitted, .approved, .rejected; governance.blueprint.certified, .activated, .rolled-back |
| Compliance | compliance.control.failed, compliance.evidence.collected, privacy.dsr.received, .completed |
| AI | ai.agent-run.started, .tool-called, .completed, .escalated; ai.guardrail.triggered |

## 16. Workflow, Decision & Rules

### 16.1 Workflow DSL (state machine + orchestration)

```yaml
apiVersion: ucos.io/v1
kind: WorkflowDefinition
id: order.lifecycle
version: 3.0.0
object: commerce.order.Order
states:
  placed:      { on: { PaymentAuthorized: confirmed, PaymentFailed: payment_failed, Cancel: cancelled } }
  confirmed:   { entry: [ reserveStock, createFulfillmentOrders, postLedger(ORDER_CONFIRMED) ],
                 on: { AllShipmentsDispatched: shipped, Cancel: cancelling } }
  shipped:     { on: { AllShipmentsDelivered: delivered, DeliveryFailed: exception } }
  delivered:   { entry: [ startTimer(returnWindow) ],
                 timers: { returnWindow: { temporalPolicy: ref(decision:returns.window-by-category), then: completed } },
                 on: { ReturnRequested: return_in_progress } }
  completed:   { final: true, entry: [ releaseSellerPayoutHold ] }
  cancelling:  { saga: [ { do: releaseStock, compensate: none },
                         { do: voidOrRefundPayment, compensate: alertFinance },
                         { do: notify(template: order-cancelled) } ],
                 then: cancelled }
  cancelled:   { final: true }
  payment_failed: { timers: { retry: { duration: PT15M, then: cancelled } }, on: { PaymentAuthorized: confirmed } }
  exception:   { humanTask: { queue: support.logistics-exceptions, sla: ref(tmp:SLA-4H-BUSINESS) },
                 on: { Resolved: shipped, Refund: cancelling } }
  return_in_progress: { subworkflow: return.flow@2, then: completed }
guards:
  Cancel: "state in [placed, confirmed] and not anyShipmentDispatched"
observability: { slo: { "placed→confirmed": "p95 < 60s" } }
```

**YAML note (A-74):** quote the `"on"` key. YAML 1.1 parsers (PyYAML, Go yaml.v2) read a bare `on:` as the boolean `true`; the machine-readable definitions in `spec/workflows/` quote it, and CI rejects boolean keys.

Human tasks support assignment rules (Decision), approvals (n-of-m, sequential, parallel), delegation, escalation chains bound to SLA clocks, and four-eyes/SoD guards from policy.

### 16.2 Decision tables (configurable business logic)

```yaml
kind: DecisionTable
id: returns.window-by-category
hitPolicy: FIRST
inputs:  [ listing.category, buyer.tier, context.jurisdiction ]
outputs: [ returnWindow (Duration), restockingFee (Percentage) ]
rules:
  - [ "electronics/*", "*",       "IN", "P7D",  "0%"  ]
  - [ "fashion/*",     "premium", "*",  "P30D", "0%"  ]
  - [ "fashion/*",     "*",       "*",  "P15D", "0%"  ]
  - [ "grocery/*",     "*",       "*",  "PT0S", "n/a" ]
  - [ "*",             "*",       "AE", "P14D", "10%" ]
  - [ "*",             "*",       "*",  "P10D", "0%"  ]
```

Other seed decision models: pricing waterfall, offer stacking, fraud scoring thresholds, seller risk tiering, payout hold rules, dispatch matching weights, support routing, credit limits, KYC escalation.

**Expression language (A-22):** CEL is the single expression language for decision cells, schema constraints, workflow guards, segment rules and policy context. FEEL is not used.

### 16.3 Automation modes

Event-driven · rule-driven · workflow-driven · schedule-driven (Temporal) · goal-driven (agent plans validated against policies) · policy-driven (obligations triggering actions).

## 17. Integration Universe

### 17.1 Connector framework

> **Owner and phase (v1.1):** U62 Integration is a Phase 1 universe. It provides the connector runtime, webhook ingress (verify, dedupe, store raw), outbound resilience, egress allow-lists, sandboxes and simulators, and signed tenant webhooks.


```yaml
kind: Connector
id: connector.carrier.delhivery
implements: [logistics.carrier-port@2]
auth: { type: api-key, secretRef: vault://tenants/{tenant}/delhivery }
capabilities: [rateQuote, createShipment, cancelShipment, trackingWebhook, pickupSchedule]
mappings:
  createShipment:
    request:  mappings/create-shipment.jsonata
    response: mappings/shipment-response.jsonata
rateLimits: { rps: 20 }
retries: { policy: exponential, max: 6, retryOn: [429, 5xx] }
webhooks: { path: /hooks/delhivery, verify: hmac-sha256 }
certification: [SEC-CONN-*, CONTRACT-*]
```

- **Ports and adapters:** packs call canonical ports (`PaymentProviderPort`, `CarrierPort`, `TaxEnginePort`, `KYCPort`, `MessagingPort`, `LLMPort`, `MapsPort`); connectors implement them.
- **Patterns:** request/response, webhook ingestion, polling, CDC (Debezium), batch/file (SFTP, EDI X12/EDIFACT), streaming, and federation (GraphQL subgraph of an external system).
- **Mapping:** declarative (JSONata/JOLT) with AI-assisted mapping suggestions that a human approves.
- **Seed connector families:** PSPs (Stripe, Adyen, Razorpay, PayU, Network International, PayPal), carriers (Delhivery, Shiprocket, Aramex, DHL, FedEx), tax (Avalara, Vertex, local GST/VAT engines), messaging (Twilio, Gupshup, Meta WhatsApp, SES, FCM/APNs), ERP/CRM (SAP S/4, Oracle, Salesforce, Dynamics, ServiceNow, Workday), maps (Google, Mapbox, OSM), KYC (Onfido, Digio), identity (Okta, Entra ID, Google), LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, self-hosted), and clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP).

### 17.2 Integration reliability

Outbound calls go through a resilience layer (timeouts, circuit breakers, bulkheads, retries with jitter, hedging for idempotent reads). Inbound webhooks are deduplicated by provider event ID. Reconciliation jobs (Temporal recurrences) compare provider state with UCOS state (payments, shipments) and open `Case`s for mismatches.

# PART IV — TRUST

## 18. Authority, Governance & Policy

### 18.1 Authority hierarchy

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  C[Universal Constitution] --> L[Constitutional Laws §3]
  L --> G[Universal Governance<br/>authorities, change control]
  G --> P[Policies]
  P --> R[Rules · Constraints · Validations ·<br/>Compliance checks · Security controls · Runtime guards]
  R --> CAP[Capabilities]
  CAP --> O[Objects]
  O --> E[Events]
  E --> A[Actions / Execution decisions]
  EV[(Evidence)] -.supports.-> L & P & R & A
```

Nothing executes outside this hierarchy, and no lower level may contradict a higher one. The policy analyser rejects any policy that permits what a Law forbids.

### 18.2 Authority types

| Type | Controls | Examples | Typical holders |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundational | Constitution, laws | Constitutional amendment, law retirement | Architecture Board (multi-party) |
| Governance | Policies, approvals, certifications | Capability certification, release approval | Governance council, CISO, DPO |
| Administrative | Configuration, operations | Tenant setup, environment config | Platform admins, tenant admins |
| Domain | Universe-specific governance | Product data stewardship, financial controls | Universe stewards |
| Operational | Runtime operations | Deploy, scale, failover, incident actions | SRE on-call |
| Autonomous | Bounded automated action | Auto-remediation, agent tool calls | AI agents, automation engines (§21.5) |

### 18.3 Authority & Decision objects

```yaml

```

### 18.4 Change control (governed change)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  P[Proposal<br/>CCP / definition change] --> V[Automated validation<br/>schema, lint, policy analysis,<br/>compat check, blast radius]
  V --> I[Impact analysis<br/>graph: affected tenants,<br/>blueprints, consumers]

  A -- rejected --> X[Rejected + reasons]
  A -- approved --> C[Certification gates]
  C --> R[Release: progressive rollout<br/>canary → cohort → all]
  R --> M[Monitor + auto-rollback guard]
```

Change classes: **Standard** (pre-approved templates, e.g. a new offer), **Normal** (one approval), **Significant** (multi-party, impact > threshold), **Constitutional** (Architecture Board, CCP, minimum review period), **Emergency** (break-glass with retrospective approval within 24h).

### 18.5 Policy model (authorisation unified)

RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC and PBAC are all expressed as **Cedar policies** evaluated by one PDP. Infrastructure and admission policies use OPA/Rego.

```cedar
// Sellers may update their own listings while their account is in good standing
permit (
  principal in Role::"seller",
  action in [Action::"catalog:UpdateListing", Action::"catalog:PublishListing"],
  resource is Catalog::Listing
)
when {
  resource.seller == principal.organization &&
  principal.organization.standing == "good" &&
  context.risk.score < 70
};

// Separation of duties on payouts
forbid (
  principal,
  action == Action::"marketplace:ApprovePayout",
  resource is Marketplace::PayoutBatch
)
when { resource.createdBy == principal };

// Agents may only act within delegated authority & budget
forbid (
  principal is Agent,
  action,
  resource
)
unless { principal.authority.actions.contains(action) && context.agent.budgetRemaining > 0 };
```

**Layered evaluation (A-11):** precedence is `platform` forbids (final) → `emergency` forbids (final) → any forbid in universe-default, tenant or organization layers → any permit. Obligations merge strictest-wins. List queries use **`PartialEvaluate`**: the residual constraint becomes a SQL/search filter, so results and facet counts are authorised before they are computed. Platform baseline P-001…P-007 (tenant isolation, inactive principals, agent bounds, **reality isolation with bridging (A-28)**, asOf read-only, separation of duties, unknown risk treated as medium) is in `spec/policies/platform-baseline.cedar`.

Policy obligations (returned with ALLOW): `mask(fields)`, `audit(level)`, `stepUpAuth`, `notify(role)`, `rateLimit(class)`, `watermark`, `requireReason`. Every PDP decision is logged with the policy IDs that matched.

### 18.6 Governance domains

Policy · Capability · AI · Data · Security · Compliance · Knowledge · Financial · Operational · Evolution · Architecture · Certification. Each has a steward authority and its own registry view in the Governance portal (W11).

---

## 19. Security Architecture

### 19.1 Principles

Zero trust · identity-first · policy-first · encryption-first · least privilege · separation of duties · multi-party approval for critical actions · secure by design / by default / by construction · continuous verification, monitoring and audit · crypto-agility.

### 19.2 Identity types & authentication

| Principal | Authentication | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| End user (buyer, patient, student) | OIDC; passkeys (WebAuthn) preferred; OTP fallback; social login optional | Risk-based step-up |
| Business user (seller, admin, agent supervisor) | OIDC + mandatory MFA (passkey/TOTP/hardware key); SSO federation (SAML/OIDC) with tenant IdP | Session binding to device |
| Workload / pack service | SPIFFE/SPIRE workload identity, mTLS | No static secrets |
| AI agent | Agent identity (`ucos:agent:*`) + signed delegation token from a human/org authority | Scoped, time-bound, budgeted |
| Device / IoT / POS | Device certificates (X.509), attestation where available | |
| External system | OAuth2 client credentials / mTLS; API keys only for low-risk read | Keys hashed, rotatable |

Identity Intelligence (KYC/KYB, sanctions/PEP screening, document verification, fraud signals) is a capability family (`identity.kyc`, `identity.kyb`). Jurisdiction rules select providers.

### 19.3 Authorisation

PDP (Cedar) at the gateway and command bus. Policies are compiled per blueprint and cached in each cell. Decision latency target p99 < 5 ms. Field-level controls come through obligations (masking/redaction). Row-level isolation is enforced by Postgres RLS using the context's tenant and organisation (defence in depth).

### 19.4 Threat model (STRIDE by layer, summary)

| Layer | Key threats | Primary controls |
|---|---|---|
| Edge/Gateway | Credential stuffing, DDoS, bot scraping, injection | WAF, bot management, rate limits, passkeys, input validation from schemas |
| Composition/Studio | Malicious definition (privilege-escalating policy), supply-chain pack | Policy analyser, multi-party approval, signed packs, SLSA provenance, pack sandboxing |
| Runtime | Cross-tenant data access, IDOR, replay | RLS, PDP on every command, ETag/idempotency, audience-bound tokens |
| Data | Exfiltration, insider misuse | Field-level encryption, DLP, PAM with session recording, just-in-time access |
| Integration | Webhook spoofing, SSRF | HMAC verification, egress allow-lists per connector |
| AI/Agents | Prompt injection, tool abuse, data leakage, excessive agency | Tool scopes, authority tokens, content isolation (untrusted-content tagging), output filters, HITL for high-risk actions |
| Supply chain | Dependency compromise | SBOM, vulnerability scanning, pinned digests, reproducible builds |
| Operations | Misconfiguration, secret leakage | GitOps, OPA admission policies, secret scanning, workload identity |

Every capability pack ships a threat model (`docs/threat-model.md`). Gate `SEC-TM-001` checks that it exists and was reviewed. The models live in `docs/threat-models/`.

### 19.5 Cryptography

- In transit: TLS 1.3 everywhere; mTLS service-to-service.
- At rest: envelope encryption. KMS/HSM-backed KEKs; **per-tenant DEKs**; optional **BYOK/HYOK** for enterprise tiers.
- Field-level: `Encrypted<T>` fields (PAN tokens, national IDs, health data) encrypted application-side with per-tenant/per-purpose keys. Searchable fields use blind indexes.
- Tokenisation: card data never touches UCOS. PSP tokens are used, keeping UCOS cardholder-data scope at SAQ-A / A-EP where possible. Network tokenisation is supported.
- In use: confidential computing nodes for designated workloads (e.g. dedicated healthcare tenants, model inference on sensitive data).
- **Crypto-agility / post-quantum readiness:** algorithm identifiers are stored with ciphertexts and signatures. Hybrid TLS key exchange (X25519+ML-KEM) where the stack supports it. ML-DSA signatures planned for audit-chain anchoring. Key rotation is automated through Temporal schedules.

### 19.6 Tenant & capability isolation

Network policies per pack; namespace per cell tier; separate KMS keys per tenant; optional dedicated cells; sandboxed WASM extensions with no network by default; per-tenant resource quotas.

### 19.7 Data classification

`public` · `internal` · `confidential` · `restricted`, crossed with data classes `PII, SPI (sensitive personal), PCI, PHI, FINANCIAL, CREDENTIAL, CHILD, BIOMETRIC, LOCATION, TRADE_SECRET`. Classification drives encryption, masking, retention, residency, logging redaction and DLP rules automatically.

**Classification is a value type** owned by U65 (A-01). Additional classes are `SECURITY_SENSITIVE` and `NEURAL`.

**Security profiles (A-15), ordered** `standard < high < regulated < sovereign`. Tenants may only choose a stricter profile.

| Control area | standard | high | regulated | sovereign |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Business-user MFA | TOTP or passkey | passkey | passkey + hardware for admins | hardware keys |
| Minimum isolation tier | pooled | pooled | schema | dedicated-cell |
| Keys | per tenant | per tenant | BYOK option | HYOK / in-country HSM |
| Audit of reads | sampled | full for restricted | full | full + external anchoring |

**Handling matrix (A-15):** `restricted` data (PII-high, SPI, PCI, PHI, CREDENTIAL, BIOMETRIC, CHILD) is field-encrypted, masked by default and never logged. It reaches AI only through zero-retention models with tenant policy and purpose. Export needs approval and a watermark.

### 19.8 Security operations

SIEM (all audit + security signals), SOAR playbooks (auto-contain: revoke tokens, isolate tenant, freeze payouts), EDR/XDR on nodes, CSPM/KSPM, continuous vulnerability scanning, continuous automated penetration testing (DAST + attack-simulation), bug bounty, incident response runbooks with legal/regulatory notification timers (Temporal triggers: GDPR 72h, CERT-In 6h, DPDP as applicable).

### 19.9 Immutable audit

```yaml
AuditRecord:
  id, time (TimePoint), tenant, actor (identity, kind, onBehalfOf), action, resource (ref + version),
  decision (allow/deny + policy ids + obligations), context hash, request hash, result,
  prevHash, hash = SHA-256(prevHash || canonical(record))
```

Records are written synchronously on the command path. Chains are per tenant per day, and daily roots are anchored to WORM storage (optionally to an external timestamping authority, RFC 3161). Audit reads are themselves audited.

```

### 20.3 Framework library (seed, extensible as data)

Privacy: GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, DPDP (India), UAE PDPL, PIPL, LGPD, PDPA (SG). Security: ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST CSF 2.0, NIST 800-53, FedRAMP, CIS. Payments/finance: PCI DSS v4, PSD2/SCA, RBI (payment aggregator, card tokenisation, data localisation), SEBI, FINRA, MiFID II, DORA, SOX. Health: HIPAA, HITECH. AI: ISO/IEC 42001, EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF. Telecom: TRAI. Sector: FDA 21 CFR Part 11, EMA, accessibility (WCAG 2.2, EN 301 549, ADA). Country- and industry-specific packs are added as data, along with future regulations.

### 20.4 Privacy capabilities

Consent & preference registry (purpose-based, versioned notices, proof of consent) · purpose limitation enforced through policy obligations · data minimisation (schema-level `purpose` tags) · retention engine · DSR portal & workflow (access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection, grievance) · records of processing (auto-generated from the graph) · DPIA templates · cross-border transfer registry · cookie/tracking consent for web channels · children's data rules (age gating, parental consent).

**DSR handler extension point (A-21):** every universe that holds personal data implements `privacy.dsr-handler` (`Export`, `Rectify`, `Erase(mode)`), checked by gate `CMP-PRV-01`. Erasure respects legal holds (U104/U68), and crypto-shredding covers event history.

### 20.5 Cross-tenant learning & aggregation

Cross-tenant learning, the federated intelligence the source mentions, is allowed only through: (1) explicit tenant opt-in recorded as a contract fact; (2) aggregation with k-anonymity ≥ configured threshold and differential-privacy noise for published statistics; (3) federated learning where raw data never leaves the tenant boundary. These are enforced by a dedicated `analytics.cross-tenant` capability with its own controls.

### 20.6 Continuous compliance

Evidence collectors run on schedules and events. Control drift creates `compliance.control.failed` events, cases and (if mandatory) gaps on affected blueprints. Audit-readiness dashboards per framework sit in the Compliance portal (W11). Auditor read-only access is time-boxed, watermarked and logged.

### 21.2 Model registry & routing

```yaml
kind: Model
id: model.anthropic.claude-opus-5-5
provider: anthropic
modelId: claude-opus-5-5
capabilities: [reasoning, tool-use, vision, long-context, code]
residency: [us, eu]              # where inference may run (per contract)
dataPolicy: { training: none, providerRetention: zero-retention-endpoint }
cost: { inputPerMTok: ..., outputPerMTok: ... }   # from price list registry, not hard-coded
evaluations: [eval.support-triage@3: 0.92, eval.catalog-attr-extract@5: 0.95]
status: certified
---
kind: Route
id: route.default
rules:   # evaluated by Decision engine
  - when: { task: complex-reasoning|agentic-planning }                then: model.anthropic.claude-opus-5-5
  - when: { task: general|tool-use, latencyBudgetMs: "<3000" }        then: model.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5-5
  - when: { task: classification|extraction|routing, volume: high }   then: model.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5
  - when: { context.dataClass: PHI, tenant.policy: on-prem-only }     then: model.selfhosted.medical-llm
fallbacks: [model.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5-5, model.selfhosted.general]
```

Default reference routing uses the Claude family: `claude-opus-5-5` for complex reasoning and agent planning, `claude-sonnet-5-5` for general and tool-use tasks, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for high-volume classification and extraction. Providers remain swappable per L15. Routing is policy, not code.

### 21.3 AI capability families

Recommendation · semantic & hybrid search · conversational commerce · support triage and answer drafting · catalog enrichment (classification, attribute extraction, translation, image tagging) · pricing intelligence · demand forecasting · fraud/risk scoring (ML models, not LLMs) · document understanding (invoices, KYC docs) · code/definition assistance in Studio (proposes definitions, never activates them) · compliance mapping assistance · anomaly explanation for ops · simulation narratives.

**Classical ML (A-42)** (features, training, serving, drift and fairness monitoring for fraud, forecasting, ranking and pricing models) is owned by **U94 ML Platform**. LLMs, prompts and agents remain U49–U51. All models share one registry and one set of AI certification gates.

### 21.4 Agent object

```yaml
kind: Agent
id: ucos:agent:catalog-enrichment
version: 1.4.0
purpose: "Enrich seller-submitted listings with taxonomy, attributes and translations."
identity: ucos:agent:catalog-enrichment            # first-class identity

  limits: { maxActionsPerHour: 5000, maxCostPerDay: { amount: "200", currency: USD } }
autonomy: L2          # propose → steward auto-approves above confidence 0.95, else human review (§29.2)
model: { route: route.default, task: extraction }
tools: [catalog.get_listing, product.search_global, taxonomy.suggest, attribute.validate, localization.propose]
memory: { type: episodic+semantic, store: vector://agent-memory/catalog, retention: P90D, tenantScoped: true }
knowledge: [kg://taxonomy, kg://attributes, kg://global-products]
guardrails: [no-pii-in-prompts, untrusted-content-isolation, output-schema-validation, profanity-filter]
evaluation: { suite: eval.catalog-attr-extract@5, minScore: 0.93, cadence: "FREQ=WEEKLY" }
escalation: { queue: catalog.steward-review, when: [confidence<0.8, conflicting-sources, regulated-category] }
audit: full            # every prompt hash, tool call, output, decision
```

### 21.5 Agent governance

- **Identity & delegation:** agents act with their own identity. When acting for a user, they carry a delegation token (`onBehalfOf`) whose scope is the intersection of the agent's authority and the user's permissions.
- **Bounded authority:** authority objects (§18.3) with action lists, monetary limits, rate limits and budgets. Financially material, irreversible, or legally significant actions need human approval (L17).
- **Tool safety:** tools are generated from commands, inherit PDP checks, and declare side-effect class (`read`, `reversible-write`, `irreversible-write`, `external-communication`).
- **Prompt-injection defence:** retrieved and user content is tagged untrusted and kept out of the system instructions. Tool-call plans are validated against policy before execution. Sensitive tools require confirmation.
- **Multi-agent orchestration:** a supervisor agent pattern with explicit hand-off contracts. Agent-to-agent messages go through the Communication universe and are audited.
- **Evaluation & drift:** offline eval suites, online quality signals (acceptance rate, edits), drift alerts, and rollback to previous prompt/model versions.
- **AI governance & regulation:** risk classification per use case (EU AI Act classes), model cards, data sheets, human oversight design, and incident reporting. ISO/IEC 42001 control mapping.

### 21.6 RAG over the Knowledge Graph

Hybrid retrieval: (1) graph traversal for authoritative facts with provenance, (2) vector search for unstructured content, (3) keyword search for exact identifiers. Answers cite object IDs. Facts below a trust threshold are excluded or flagged. Tenant boundaries are enforced in retrieval filters, never only in prompts.

# PART V — EXPERIENCE

## 22. Experience Architecture

### 22.1 UI is metadata, renderers are code

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  OT[Object Types §7.3] --> VM[View Models<br/>list · detail · form · board ·<br/>calendar · map · timeline · dashboard ·<br/>wizard · chat]
  WF[Workflows / Human tasks] --> VM

  R --> CHAT[Chat / WhatsApp: conversational renderer]
  R --> AGENT[Agent UI: MCP tools + structured cards]
  R --> XR[AR/VR: adapter contract, future]
```

The same `ViewDefinition` renders on every channel. Each renderer maps abstract components (`Field`, `Collection`, `Action`, `Media`, `Map`, `Calendar`, `Chart`) to native widgets. Channels that cannot render a component fall back through declared fallbacks (for example, a map falls back to an address list on voice).

### 22.2 View definition (UI meta-model)

**Communication channels (A-64, A-65).** Notifications and messages over email, SMS, WhatsApp, web and mobile push, in-app inbox, RCS, Telegram, LINE, WeChat, Viber, Messenger, Instagram, voice and postal mail are owned by U40, with an adapter per channel. Inbound replies (opt-out first), real-time chat (presence, typing, receipts, masked parties), broadcast and emergency alerts, and agent-to-agent messaging are also U40. Synchronous voice, IVR, video sessions, live chat with bot hand-off, and the contact centre are owned by **U109**.

## 23. UI/UX Design System & Principles

### 23.1 UX principles for a composition platform

1. **Intent first, configuration second:** builders describe outcomes ("multi-vendor marketplace in India and UAE"). The system proposes, and the builder refines.
2. **Explain every automatic decision:** every auto-added capability, control or gap has a "Why?" link to its resolution trace (§11.3).
3. **Preview, simulate, diff, then apply:** no change goes live without a visible diff and an optional simulation run.
4. **Safe by default:** destructive or high-risk actions require confirmation, reason capture and step-up auth, with undo where reversible.
5. **Progressive disclosure:** sensible defaults hide advanced settings until needed. Expert mode exposes raw YAML with schema-aware editing.
6. **One mental model:** every object has the same anatomy (header, status, key facts, tabs: Details · Relationships · Timeline · Policies · Audit · Evidence).
7. **Status is always visible:** lifecycle state, certification badge, gap count and environment (sandbox/simulation/production) are pinned in the header.
8. **Accessible and global by construction:** WCAG 2.2 AA minimum, RTL, locale-aware formats, plain language.
9. **Human-in-the-loop clarity:** AI suggestions are visually distinct, show confidence and source, and are never auto-applied unless authority allows it.
10. **Performance as UX:** interactive in < 2.5s (LCP) on mid-range mobile over 4G; optimistic UI where safe.

### 23.2 Design tokens (theming & white-label)

```json
{
  "color": {
    "brand":   { "primary": "{tenant.brand.primary|#4F46E5}", "onPrimary": "#FFFFFF" },
    "neutral": { "0": "#FFFFFF", "50": "#F8FAFC", "100": "#F1F5F9", "700": "#334155", "900": "#0F172A" },
    "status":  { "success": "#15803D", "warning": "#B45309", "danger": "#B91C1C", "info": "#1D4ED8" },
    "gap":     { "mandatory": "#B91C1C", "recommended": "#B45309", "optional": "#64748B" }
  },
  "font":   { "family": { "base": "{tenant.font|Inter}, system-ui", "mono": "JetBrains Mono" },
              "size": { "xs": 12, "sm": 14, "md": 16, "lg": 20, "xl": 24, "2xl": 32 } },
  "space":  { "1": 4, "2": 8, "3": 12, "4": 16, "6": 24, "8": 32 },
  "radius": { "sm": 4, "md": 8, "lg": 12, "full": 9999 },
  "motion": { "fast": "120ms", "base": "200ms", "reduce": "respect prefers-reduced-motion" },
  "breakpoints": { "sm": 0, "md": 768, "lg": 1024, "xl": 1440 },
  "modes": ["light", "dark", "high-contrast"]
}
```

Tenant themes override only tokens, never components. Contrast is validated automatically (≥ 4.5:1 for text). A theme that fails contrast creates a `UI` gap.

### 23.3 Component library (abstract → per-renderer)

App shell · Navigation (sidebar, top bar, tab bar, breadcrumb) · Object header · Data table (virtualised, column config, saved views, bulk actions) · Card · Form fields (text, number, money, quantity+unit, temporal pickers, reference picker, taxonomy tree picker, address/geo picker, asset uploader, rich text, code/YAML editor) · Status badge · Gap badge · Certification badge · Timeline · Kanban board · Calendar (month/week/day/resource grid) · Map · Graph canvas (composition/dependency) · Diff viewer · Chart set (via the dataviz standard) · Wizard/stepper · Command palette (⌘K) · AI suggestion chip · Approval panel · Empty states · Skeletons · Toasts · Modal/drawer.

### 23.4 Accessibility, localisation, personalisation

- **A11y:** semantic landmarks, keyboard paths for every action, focus management on route change, ARIA only where semantics are insufficient, captions/transcripts for media, motion reduction. Automated axe checks in CI plus manual audits on top journeys (gate `A11Y-*`).
- **Localisation:** ICU MessageFormat; no string literals in views (lint). Pseudo-localisation in CI. RTL mirroring. Locale-aware number, currency, date, address and name formats from the Localization universe. Translation workflow: machine translation, then human review for regulated or customer-facing strings.
- **Personalisation:** recommendation placements, saved views, role-based home dashboards, adaptive navigation (frequently used first), all consent-aware.

    Approve release (MFA): 5: Owner
    Canary to full rollout: 5: Runtime
```

### 24.3 Journey J2: Add a new country (zero code)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Builder adds country = SA<br/>to Platform Definition] --> B[Composer: jurisdiction facts]
  B --> C[Derives: SAR currency, ar-SA locale,<br/>VAT KSA, PDPL-SA, ZATCA e-invoicing,<br/>Mada payments adapter, KSA holidays]

  G --> H[Capability Marketplace search /<br/>request pack build]
  H --> I[Pack built once, certified,<br/>reused by every tenant]
  I --> E
```

### 24.4 Journey J3: Seller onboarding (marketplace)

```mermaid

  actor S as Seller
  participant SP as Seller Portal
  participant ID as Identity/KYB
  participant WF as Workflow seller.onboarding
  participant CM as Compliance
  participant LG as Ledger
  S->>SP: Sign up (business email, passkey)
  SP->>ID: Create org identity, start KYB (tax ID, bank, documents)

  WF->>CM: Screen sanctions/PEP, category restrictions (rules by jurisdiction)
  CM-->>WF: Cleared

  S->>SP: Sign seller agreement
  WF->>LG: Open seller ledger accounts, payout schedule (Temporal: T+7 settlement calendar)
  WF-->>S: Welcome; listing tools unlocked (Entitlement)
```

### 24.5 Journey J4: Buyer purchase (storefront, cross-capability)

```mermaid

  F --> G[Fulfillment & tracking<br/>Logistics + Communication]
  G --> H[Delivered → review prompt<br/>Trust & Reputation]
  H --> I[Return window timer<br/>Temporal + Decision]
```

### 24.6 Journey J5: Governed change & approval

Proposal → automated validation → impact analysis (affected tenants, consumers) → simulation → approval (authority by scope; MFA) → certification → progressive rollout → monitoring with auto-rollback. See §18.4 and wireframe W11.

### 24.7 Journey J6: Data subject request

Request via portal/app/email → identity verification → scope discovery (graph: all objects linked to subject) → legal-hold check → fulfil (export package or erase/crypto-shred) → evidence → response within jurisdictional deadline (Temporal SLA clock) → audit.

## 25. Wireframes

Low-fidelity wireframes for the key screens. They define **layout, hierarchy and behaviour**, not visual styling (§23 covers that). Desktop width is ~120 columns. Mobile wireframes are marked 📱.

### v1.2 additions — universe screens (W17–W40)

These screens cover the universes specified in v1.2 (A-71). They follow the same conventions as W1–W16. Each one names the universes whose commands and queries it uses, so a screen never invents behaviour that no universe owns.

# PART VI — OPERATE & EVOLVE

## 26. Observability, Operations & Resilience

### 26.1 Signals

All components emit **OpenTelemetry** traces, metrics and logs with standard resource attributes (`ucos.cell`, `ucos.tenant` (hashed in shared backends), `ucos.capability`, `ucos.blueprint`, `ucos.command`, `ucos.agent`).

| Signal family | Examples | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | latency, errors, saturation, queue lag, DB locks | SRE, AIOps |
| Business | orders/min, GMV, conversion, payout volume, cart abandonment | Tenants, leadership, anomaly detection |
| Security | auth failures, policy denies, anomaly scores, WAF blocks | SOC/SIEM |
| Compliance | control pass/fail/drift, evidence freshness, DSR SLA | DPO, compliance |
| AI | tokens, cost, latency, eval scores, guardrail triggers, escalation rate | AI Ops |
| Governance | pending approvals, waivers expiring, certification status | Governance |
| Knowledge | registry quality scores, conflicts, stale facts | Stewards |
| Cost | per tenant, per capability, per cell (FinOps) | Finance, platform |

Correlation: every signal carries `traceId` + `ucoscorrelation`, so business events, policy decisions, AI outputs and infra metrics can be joined for a single customer interaction.

### 26.2 SLOs & availability tiers

| Tier | Availability | RPO | RTO | Topology |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T0 (control plane, identity, payments path) | 99.99% | ≤ 1 min | ≤ 15 min | Multi-AZ active-active; cross-region warm standby |
| T1 (core commerce, orders, ledger) | 99.95% | ≤ 5 min | ≤ 30 min | Multi-AZ; cross-region DR |
| T2 (search, recommendations, analytics, reporting) | 99.9% | ≤ 1 h | ≤ 4 h | Multi-AZ; rebuildable from events |
| T3 (batch, simulation, sandbox) | 99.5% | ≤ 24 h | ≤ 24 h | Single region |

Each capability declares SLOs in its manifest. Error-budget policies gate releases: when the budget is exhausted, only reliability fixes ship.

### 26.3 Operations model

- **Incident management:** severity matrix, on-call rotations per universe team, incident commander role, status page per tenant, post-incident reviews feeding Evolution proposals.
- **Runbooks:** generated per capability (from manifest + failure scenarios), maintained as code, executable steps via SOAR/automation, with authority checks.
- **AIOps:** anomaly detection on signals; probable-cause ranking using the dependency graph; suggested remediations with simulation (W14). Auto-remediation only for pre-approved runbook steps (autonomy L3, §29.2).
- **Capacity & FinOps:** per-tenant cost attribution, forecasted capacity from business signals (Temporal forecasts), rightsizing recommendations, budgets and anomaly alerts.
- **Sustainability:** carbon intensity per cell and per workload, available to tenants as a signal.

### 26.4 Resilience engineering

Cell-based architecture limits blast radius · bulkheads per tenant tier · backpressure and load shedding (priority classes: checkout > browse > analytics) · graceful degradation (e.g. search falls back to category browse; recommendations to popular items; tax estimate to "calculated at checkout") · backups (PITR for Postgres, Kafka tiered storage, object versioning) with **automated restore tests** weekly · DR drills quarterly (gate `DR-*`) · chaos experiments in pre-prod continuously and in prod with guardrails (game days).

### 26.5 Digital twins (scoped, practical)

| Twin | Built from | Questions it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **Platform Twin** | blueprint + live telemetry + dependency graph | What runs where, what's healthy, what breaks if X fails? |
| **Business Twin** | events + ledger + forecasts | Revenue, margin, inventory position; what-if pricing/offers |
| **Supply-chain Twin** | inventory + fulfillment + logistics events | Stock-outs, delivery promise accuracy, capacity |
| **Customer Twin** (consented, aggregate-first) | CRM + behaviour | Segments, churn risk, journeys |
| **Security/Compliance Twin** | controls + evidence + findings | Posture, drift, audit readiness |
| **Organization Twin** | org, roles, authority graph | Who can approve what; SoD coverage |

Twins are projections maintained by the Twin engine. The Simulation universe runs scenarios against twin snapshots (`asOf`, synthetic load, policy changes).

## 27. Infrastructure & Deployment

### 27.1 Topology

    C4[Cell ae-auh-1 (DR)]
  end
  subgraph Region_EU[Region: EU]
    C5[Cell eu-fra-1]
  end
  DNS --> C1 & C3 & C5
  CP --> C1 & C3 & C5
  C1 -. async replication .-> C2
  C3 -. async replication .-> C4
  REGG --> C1 & C3 & C5
  PKGR --> C1 & C3 & C5
```

- **Cloud-agnostic by design:** Kubernetes for compute; OpenTofu + Crossplane for provisioning; only managed services with portable equivalents (Postgres, Kafka API, S3 API, Redis API). Each cloud-specific service is wrapped in an infrastructure port.
- **Deployment targets:** public cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP), sovereign cloud, on-prem (for government/regulated tenants, using the same Helm/Crossplane bundles), edge nodes (stores, warehouses, factories) running a reduced data-plane profile with store-and-forward sync.
- **GPU pools:** for self-hosted models and embeddings; scheduled by priority; per-tenant quotas.

**Placement and Activation (A-16)** are first-class objects (U73 §3.2, §3.4):
- **Placement** assigns each tenant *shard* (by jurisdiction, organisation or data class) to a compliant cell. Residency is solved by rules, with ≥ 30% headroom.
- **Activation** is the governed rollout of a blueprint into cells: ensure packs are deployed, install policy, decision and API bundles, run expand migrations, flip routing per wave, watch guards, and run contract migrations only after the hold (rollback stays possible until then).

### 27.2 Environments

`dev` → `ci-ephemeral` (per PR) → `integration` → `staging` (production-like, synthetic tenants) → `production` cells. Plus **sandbox** (per tenant, for builders and developers) and **simulation** cells (no external side effects).

### 27.3 Delivery pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  PR[PR: pack / platform / definition] --> CI[CI: build, unit, lint (L2/L1 rules),<br/>SAST, SCA, secret scan, SBOM]
  CI --> SIGN[Sign image & pack<br/>cosign + SLSA provenance]
  SIGN --> EPH[Ephemeral env:<br/>contract + scenario + a11y tests]
  EPH --> CERT[Certification gates §28]
  CERT --> STG[Staging: perf, chaos, DR smoke]
  STG --> APPROVE{Release authority<br/>approval}
  APPROVE --> GITOPS[GitOps (Argo CD):<br/>canary cell → wave 1 → wave 2 → all]
  GITOPS --> GUARD[Automated rollback on SLO burn /<br/>error-rate guard]
```

Definitions (tenant blueprints) follow the same flow, minus compilation: validate → compose → certify → approve → progressive activation (tenant cohorts) → guard.

### 27.4 Platform kernel vs packs: release cadence

| Artifact | Cadence | Compatibility |
|---|---|---|
| Platform kernel & engines | Bi-weekly minor; quarterly major (with 12-month support for N-1) | Engine APIs SemVer; pack runtime contract versioned |
| Capability packs | Continuous (per pack) | SemVer; compatibility checked against blueprints using them |
| Global registries (reference data, taxonomies, holiday calendars, regulations) | Continuous, governed by stewards | Additive by default; breaking changes via Evolution |
| Tenant blueprints | On demand | Pinned versions; auto-upgrade policy per tenant (patch auto, minor opt-in, major planned) |

---

## 28. Testing, Certification & Release

### 28.1 Test strategy (generated + authored)

| Level | What | Generated? |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | Pack handlers, decision logic | Authored |
| Schema & contract | API/event schemas vs consumers (Pact-style); data contracts | Generated from manifests |
| Policy | Cedar policy tests (allow/deny matrices), SoD checks, policy analyser proofs | Generated + authored |
| Scenario (BDD) | Business flows per capability and per blueprint (Gherkin) | Generated skeletons + authored |
| Integration | Pack ↔ engines ↔ adapters (with provider sandboxes/simulators) | Generated |
| End-to-end journeys | Top journeys per portal/channel (Playwright, Detox) | Generated from Journey definitions |
| Performance | Load profiles per capability (k6), soak, spike | Generated from SLOs + scale in PD |
| Resilience | Chaos experiments, failover, restore tests | Templates |
| Security | SAST, DAST, dependency, container, IaC scans; fuzzing of APIs from schemas; pen tests | Generated + external |
| Compliance | Control tests (§20.2), evidence presence & freshness | Generated from controls |
| Accessibility | axe-core on all views; screen-reader journeys on top flows | Generated + manual |
| Localisation | Pseudo-locale, RTL snapshots, missing-key checks | Generated |
| AI | Eval suites, red-teaming prompts, guardrail tests, regression on golden sets | Authored + generated |
| Composition | Determinism (same input → same hash), gap rule regression | Generated |

### 28.2 Certification gates

| Gate | Criteria (summary) | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| `ARCH-*` | Manifest complete; layer and dependency rules respected; no ownership collision; traceability chain complete; naming conventions | packs, blueprints |
| `SEC-*` | Threat model reviewed; no critical/high vulns open; secrets scan clean; SBOM + signature + provenance; policy tests pass; pen-test (for T0/T1 packs) within 12 months | packs, blueprints |
| `CMP-*` | All required controls mapped and implemented; evidence collectors active; residency satisfied | blueprints, packs |
| `TEST-*` | Coverage thresholds (unit ≥ 80% of handlers, 100% of decision tables), all contract/scenario tests green | packs, blueprints |
| `PERF-*` | Meets SLO targets at declared scale + 30% headroom | packs, blueprints |
| `A11Y-*` | Zero critical axe violations; top journeys pass manual audit | UI views, portals |
| `DOC-*` | User/admin/API docs and runbooks exist and are current | packs, blueprints |
| `OBS-*` | Signals, dashboards, alerts and SLOs defined; alert routes configured | packs, blueprints |
| `DR-*` | Backup policy defined; last restore test passed within 30 days (T0/T1) | blueprints, cells |
| `AI-*` | Eval ≥ threshold; guardrails configured; authority bounded; model card present | agents, AI features |
| `GAP-000` | `mandatory_gap_count = 0`; recommended gaps resolved or waived | blueprints |

### 28.3 Certification record

```yaml
kind: Certification
id: ucos:cert:01J...
subject: ucos:blueprint:sha256:7f3c...
gates:
  - { id: SEC-007, result: pass, evidence: [ucos:evidence:sast-run-8812], at: 2026-10-02T10:12Z }
  - { id: CMP-021, result: pass, evidence: [ucos:evidence:control-test-dsr-erasure-w40] }
  - { id: GAP-000, result: pass, details: { mandatory: 0, recommended: 2, waived: 2 } }
waivers: [ucos:waiver:W-88, ucos:waiver:W-91]
validUntil: 2027-01-02            # re-certification cadence (or on change)
signedBy: ucos:svc:certification   # Sigstore-signed attestation (in-toto format)
approvedBy: ucos:decision:01J...   # release authority decision
```

Certification is **continuous**. Material changes (pack upgrade, policy change, control drift, expiring waiver) trigger re-evaluation, and expired certifications raise gaps.

**v1.1 (A-17):**
- Records carry `profile` (which gate set applied, by subject kind × tier × security profile), `subjectDigest`, and a **DSSE / in-toto attestation** signed by the certification service.
- Invalidating an **active** blueprint never shuts it down automatically. It opens a mandatory gap with a grace period (default 7 days, 1 day for security). Expiry escalates to the governance authority, which decides on restriction.

---

## 29. Evolution & Autonomy

### 29.1 Evolution engine

Inputs: telemetry, gap scans, incidents, AI insights, new regulations (regulatory-change feeds), new providers, usage analytics, feedback.

Outputs: **EvolutionProposals** (new capability, new universe, schema evolution, policy change, deprecation, optimisation, new registry entries, constitutional amendment proposals). Every proposal goes through governed change (§18.4). Nothing self-applies above its autonomy level.

### 29.2 Autonomy levels

| Level | Name | The system may… | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | Observe | detect and report | Gap scans, drift detection |
| L1 | Suggest | propose changes with rationale and simulation | "Add SLO alert", "Split role for SoD" |
| L2 | Draft & auto-approve low risk | create definitions in Draft; auto-approve within explicit confidence/risk thresholds | catalog enrichment ≥ 0.95, translation of non-legal strings |
| L3 | Act within runbooks | execute pre-approved remediation steps | restart, scale out, failover to DR, shift PSP traffic per pre-approved rule, revoke compromised token |
| L4 | Bounded autonomy | optimise parameters within guardrails continuously | dynamic pricing within min/max bands; bid optimisation within budget |
| — | **Never autonomous** | — | constitutional changes, authority grants, irreversible financial movements above thresholds, data deletion outside DSR/retention rules, disabling security controls |

### 29.3 Self-healing loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  D[Detect<br/>anomaly / SLO burn / drift] --> A[Analyse<br/>dependency graph RCA]
  A --> P[Plan<br/>select runbook / remediation]
  P --> V{Within authority<br/>& simulation OK?}
  V -- yes --> X[Execute]
  V -- no --> H[Escalate to human<br/>with plan + evidence]
  X --> VER[Verify<br/>signals recovered]
  VER -- no --> RB[Rollback] --> H
  VER -- yes --> REC[Record decision, evidence,<br/>learning signal]
```

### 29.4 Schema & capability evolution rules

- **Additive changes** (new optional field, new event, new command) are minor versions and auto-compatible.
- **Breaking changes** need a major version. The **expand → migrate → contract** pattern is mandatory. Events are dual-published for ≥ 90 days. APIs announce deprecation with `Sunset` headers ≥ 6 months ahead (T0/T1 APIs: ≥ 12 months).
- **Migrations** are definitions (`Migration` objects) with forward and backward scripts, dry-run on a snapshot, and progress tracking per tenant.
- **Deprecation** requires a published successor or explicit retirement rationale. Consumers are notified, and the graph tracks remaining consumers until zero.

### 29.5 Continuous discovery questions (Completeness Engine schedule)

| Question | Detector | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| What is missing? | Gap rules over blueprints & registries | On change + nightly |
| What is duplicated / overlapping? | Ontology similarity + `provides` collisions + embedding similarity on definitions | Weekly |
| What conflicts? | Policy analyser, temporal overlap, capability conflicts | On change |
| What violates law/architecture/security/compliance? | Lint rules, policy analysis, control tests | On change + continuous |
| What is obsolete/unused? | Usage telemetry + graph consumer counts | Monthly |
| What under-performs? | SLO/error-budget + cost per outcome | Daily |
| What should be created? | Unresolved intents from Studio, failed searches in marketplace, support cases, regulatory feeds | Weekly |

### 29.6 Simulation

Simulation cells run blueprints with simulated adapters, synthetic tenants/users (agent-driven load), and `asOf` time control. Scenario types: business (pricing, offers, demand), security (attack simulation), compliance (new regulation impact), infrastructure (failover, capacity), AI (model swap), and market (competitor price moves). Outputs are compared to baselines and attached to proposals as evidence.

### 29.7 Future horizon (extension points, not current scope)

> **v1.1 (A-23…A-28):** the frame mechanism now exists as **U77 Existence & Reality Frame**. Realities (physical, virtual world, simulated, hypothetical; multiverse branches), bodies (Earth → Mars → stations → galaxies → virtual worlds), spatial frames, time scales, calendar systems, monetary systems, unit systems, language systems and governing authorities are registry data. Earth, UTC, ISO 4217, SI and BCP 47 are defaults. Geography, Temporal, Currency, Localization, Context and Policy (reality isolation) consume frames. Gate `ARCH-FRM-02` proves the foundation algorithms under a synthetic non-Earth frame.


Quantum computing, robotics fleets, autonomous vehicles, space/interplanetary commerce, synthetic economies, digital humans, brain-computer interfaces and AGI/ASI-class agents appear in the source vision. They are **not built now**. The architecture absorbs them through:
- `Future Object` → new ObjectTypes via the Meta universe;
- new **channel renderers** (Experience) and **device identities** (Identity);
- new **compute pools** (Infrastructure ports, e.g. quantum job port);
- new **agent authority classes** (Authority);
- new **regulations** (Compliance as data);
- the Evolution engine's proposal process.

Under L20 (Discover the Unknown), the measure of success is that none of these require re-architecting, only new registry entries and new packs.

# PART VII — BUILD

## 30. Reference Compositions (Worked Examples)

Each reference composition is a **Platform Definition + capability bundle** maintained in the Industry Template registry. They prove the "no code change" claim: certification of the second, third and fourth vertical MUST NOT require kernel changes (Phase 6 exit criterion, §32).

### 30.1 Composition matrix

| Capability ↓ / Platform → | Amazon-like marketplace | Uber-like mobility | Netflix-like OTT | Airbnb-like stays | Salesforce-like CRM | SAP-like ERP | Zerodha-like brokerage | ServiceNow-like ITSM |

### 30.2 Deep example: Uber-like composition (key definitions only)

```yaml
# PlatformDefinition excerpt
spec:
  template: ucos:industry-template:ride-hailing@1
  geography: { countries: [IN], cities: [BLR, HYD, MUM] }
  capabilities:
    include: [mobility.dispatch, mobility.matching, pricing.dynamic, trust.ratings, payment.core, identity.kyc]
---
# Dynamic pricing = Decision + Temporal + Geo (no code)
kind: DecisionTable
id: mobility.surge-multiplier
hitPolicy: FIRST
inputs:  [ zone.demandSupplyRatio, temporal.window, context.weather ]
outputs: [ multiplier ]
rules:
  - [ ">2.5", "*",                 "*",     "2.0" ]
  - [ ">1.8", "tmp:peak-hours-blr","*",     "1.6" ]
  - [ ">1.3", "*",                 "rain",  "1.4" ]
  - [ "*",    "*",                 "*",     "1.0" ]
guardrails: { max: 2.0, regulatoryCap: ref(compliance:in-ka-aggregator-fare-cap) }

# Driver shift availability = Temporal AvailabilityWindow on Resource(vehicle+driver)
kind: AvailabilityWindow
resource: ucos:resource:driver-01J...
recurrence: "FREQ=DAILY"
window: { local: "07:00-15:00" }
calendar: ucos:cal:in-ka-holidays
```

### 30.3 Deep example: Netflix-like OTT

Subscription plans (Subscription) → Entitlements (resolution: HD/4K, screens: 1/2/4, downloads) → content rights windows (Temporal policies per territory from content licences, Compliance + Geography) → playback authorisation (`media:Play` policy checks entitlement × territory × device count × parental rating) → recommendations (AI) → dunning workflow (Temporal recurrences + Communication). New plans, territories or rating systems are added as data.

### 30.4 Deep example: SAP-like ERP slice (Procure-to-Pay)

PurchaseRequisition → approval workflow (Decision: amount × cost centre → approver chain; SoD) → PurchaseOrder → GoodsReceipt (Inventory) → Supplier Invoice (Document + AI extraction) → three-way match (Decision) → Ledger posting (double-entry, fiscal calendar from Temporal) → Payment run (Temporal recurrence, Payment) → period close.

## 31. Technology Stack, Repository & NFRs

### 31.1 Reference technology stack

These choices are the recommended defaults. Each sits behind a port, so alternatives can be swapped per L15 without changing packs.

| Concern | Default | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel/engines language | **Go** (gateway filters, command bus, object service, scheduler, connectors runtime) | Rust for hot paths |
| Packs language | **Go** or **Kotlin/JVM** (SDKs for both); **TypeScript** for UI-adjacent and lightweight packs | Any language implementing the gRPC pack contract |
| Extensions sandbox | **WASM** (Wasmtime) via Extism-style host functions | — |
| Studio, Console, portals | **TypeScript, React, Next.js**; design system in Storybook | — |

| ADR-002 | Control plane / data plane split with cells | Blast radius, residency, scale-out (§5.4, §27) |
| ADR-003 | Hybrid physical model: generated tables for core types, JSONB for tenant extensions | Performance + flexibility (§14.2) |
| ADR-004 | Temporal is a foundation universe; no raw start/end dates in other universes | Knowledge Once (§9) |
| ADR-005 | Single PDP (Cedar) for RBAC/ABAC/ReBAC/PBAC | One policy language, analysable (§18.5) |
| ADR-006 | Composition rules in Datalog over the Knowledge Graph | Deterministic, explainable, data-extensible (§11.3) |
| ADR-007 | Transactional outbox + sagas; no distributed 2PC | Reliability at scale (§13.3) |
| ADR-008 | Global Product master separated from tenant Listings | Reuse without leakage of tenant data (§10.1) |
| ADR-009 | Packs as signed OCI artifacts with SBOM + SLSA provenance; WASM for in-process extensions | Supply-chain security (§8.3) |
| ADR-010 | AI via gateway with policy-based routing; agents are identities with bounded authority | Vendor agnosticism + safety (§21) |

| ADR-014 | Frames of reference (U77) make every foundation frame-aware | Future regions, planets, realities as data (A-23…A-28) |
| ADR-015 | Communication in every platform's base set | Legal and transactional notices from day one (A-60) |
| ADR-016 | Durable workflow engine for long-running processes | Retries, timers, compensation, visibility |
| ADR-017 | Go kernel; Go and TypeScript SDKs | Latency, simple deployment, hiring |
| ADR-018 | Reference checker before the production composer | Continuous spec consistency; golden blueprints as acceptance tests |
| ADR-019 | Derived manifests for later-phase universes | Platform-wide ownership checks now |
| ADR-020 | Postgres row-level security as the tenancy guard | Defence in depth for shared-schema tenancy |
| ADR-021 | Keycloak as reference IdP (provisional, spike S-02) | Mature OIDC/SAML/WebAuthn behind the U09 port |
| ADR-022 | Embedded Go Datalog evaluator; Python checker as oracle (provisional, S-01) | Determinism, provenance, one control-plane language |
| ADR-023 | Reservation counters in Postgres sub-slots | One transactional store |
| ADR-024 | OpenTofu modules wrapped by Crossplane | Cells as an API with drift reconciliation |
| ADR-025 | gVisor for third-party packs | Kernel-level isolation for untrusted code |
| ADR-026 | Cedar only; OpenFGA not adopted | One policy language |
| ADR-027 | Bundle code lists only when licence allows multi-tenant redistribution | Legal safety; licence as data |
| ADR-028 | Multi-region tenants via data shards in several cells | Residency per data class |
| ADR-029 | Format-preserving tokenisation for national IDs and bank accounts | Minimise exposure outside PSP flows |
| ADR-030 | Global product sourcing order and provenance | Coverage with traceable licences |
| ADR-031 | In-house IN/UAE tax packs; adapters elsewhere | Precision at launch, breadth later |
| ADR-032 | Temporal.io as the durable engine | Durability and versioning |
| ADR-033 | React Native mobile renderer | One renderer language |
| ADR-034 | Architecture Board composition | Separation of duties |
| ADR-035 | Ownership of legal interpretations | Accountability for controls |
| ADR-036 | Deterministic CI with no person or AI in the loop | Reproducible checks; no drift |

## 34. Build Rules for Humans & AI Agents

This section is the **operating manual** for anyone, including an AI coding agent, building UCOS from this document.

### 34.1 Golden rules

1. **Registry first.** Before writing code for a concept, search the registries/spec (`spec/`) for an existing owner. If one exists, reference it; never re-model it (L1, L3).
2. **No raw time, money or location.** Use `TemporalRef`, `Money`/`Quantity` and `Reference→geo.*`. A field named `*_date`, `start*`, `end*`, `price` (number) or `country` (string) outside its owning universe is a lint error.
3. **No hard-coded business variability.** Thresholds, rules, windows, lists of countries/currencies/providers belong in Decision tables, TemporalPolicies, reference data or Context rules.
4. **Packs only.** Business behaviour lives in `packs/`; kernel code is generic. Vendor SDKs only in `packs/adapters/`.
5. **Everything has a manifest.** A pack without a complete `capability.yaml` (§8.2) does not build.
6. **Commands through the bus, data through the SDK.** Never bypass the command bus or the pack SDK (tenancy, audit, outbox and policy depend on it).
7. **Events are contracts.** Register before emitting; never break within a major version.
8. **Strings are translatable.** No user-facing literals in code or views; use i18n keys.
9. **Every change is explainable.** Link PRs to the definition/proposal ID; update traceability.
10. **Tests and signals ship with the feature.** Contract tests, scenario tests, metrics, SLOs and runbook entries are part of "done".
11. **Security defaults are never weakened** in code. Exceptions are policy waivers with authority and expiry.
12. **AI output is a proposal** until a human or an authorised policy accepts it.

13. **Run the checker.** `python3 tools/ucos_check.py` MUST pass (0 errors, 0 mandatory gaps on all reference platforms) before any definition or manifest change merges. Update `TEMPORAL-BINDING-MATRIX.md` and `COVERAGE-REGISTER.md` when you add universes, capabilities or time needs.

### 34.2 Definition of Done (pack or definition change)

- [ ] Concept ownership verified (no duplicate in registry/ontology)
- [ ] Manifest/definition complete and valid (`ucos lint` clean)
- [ ] Schemas, events, APIs registered; compatibility check passes
- [ ] Policies written + policy tests (allow/deny matrix, SoD)
- [ ] Compliance controls mapped (if data classes/jurisdictions apply)
- [ ] Temporal/Money/Geo value types used correctly
- [ ] Unit + contract + scenario tests green; coverage thresholds met
- [ ] UI views via meta-model; a11y checks pass; i18n keys present (incl. RTL check)
- [ ] OTel signals, SLOs, alerts, dashboards, runbook updated
- [ ] Threat model updated (if attack surface changed)
- [ ] Docs (user/admin/API) updated
- [ ] `ucos compose` on reference blueprints shows no new mandatory gaps
- [ ] Certification gates green; signed artifact published

### 34.3 How an AI agent should approach a build task

```text
1. Read §34, then §3 (laws), §7 (meta-model), §8 (pack spec).
2. Locate the universe in §6.2 that owns the concept. If none → stop and draft an EvolutionProposal
   (new universe/object type) instead of coding.
3. Check spec/ for existing object types, events, decisions, policies to reuse.
4. Write/extend definitions in spec/ (YAML) first; run `ucos lint` and `ucos compose` on a reference PD.
5. Implement behaviour in packs/<capability>/src using the SDK; adapters only in packs/adapters/.
6. Add tests (contract, scenario, policy), signals, docs, i18n keys.
7. Run `ucos gaps` and `ucos certify --gates ARCH,SEC,TEST` locally; fix until green.
8. Open a PR referencing the proposal/definition IDs; include the gap report and trace output.
```

### 34.4 What "complete" means

Even fully implemented, this platform is never "finished forever". New industries, regulations, technologies and interaction models will keep appearing. What this architecture makes complete is **the framework for completeness**:

- every capability has a canonical home, an owner, a lifecycle and governance;
- every requirement is derived explainably from context by data-driven rules;
- every missing, conflicting or uncertified element is detected before activation;
- every new domain is absorbed through registries, packs and governed evolution, never through re-architecture.

When those four properties hold, any new team or agent can read this document, generate artifacts consistently, detect gaps automatically, and continue building without re-architecting the platform.
