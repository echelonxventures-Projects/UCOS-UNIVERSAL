# UCOS Ω∞ — Universal Coverage Register & Extensibility Protocol

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Document ID | `UCOS-COVERAGE` |
| Version | 1.0.0 |
| Authority | Constitution-level companion to `UCOS-MASTER-ARCHITECTURE.md` (Law L1 Knowledge Once, L3 Canonical Ownership, L20 Discover the Unknown) |
| Purpose | (1) Assign **every domain, concept and capability** to exactly one canonical home. (2) Define how **anything not yet listed** is added later, for any region, planet, galaxy, reality, language, currency, time system or unit, without re-architecting. |

> **How to read:** each row gives a domain or concept, its canonical home (universe id), the delivery phase, and its spec status. ✅ = universe spec written (v0.1). ⬜ = universe named, spec planned for that phase. 📦 = delivered as an industry or provider **pack** composed from universes (no new primitives). If something is missing from this register, §Z (Extensibility Protocol) says exactly how to add it.

## Z. Extensibility Protocol: how anything new is added

Every new requirement, whether a new country, planet, currency, language, regulation, industry, product type, channel or reality, follows the **same five-step decision**. None of them requires changing existing universes' code.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  N[New thing requested or discovered] --> S{1. Search register,<br/>ontology U05, registries}
  S -- exists --> R[Reuse: reference it]
  S -- not found --> C{2. Classify the novelty}
  C -->|New instance of a known kind<br/>e.g. a country, holiday, currency, language, product, planet instance| D[Add DATA to the owning registry<br/>governed standard/normal change]
  C -->|New kind within an owning universe<br/>e.g. new body kind, new payment method type, new calendar system| K[Add KIND to registry enumeration<br/>+ conversion/adapter pack if behaviour differs<br/>significant change]
  C -->|New behaviour on existing objects<br/>e.g. new pricing algorithm, new carrier| P[Build a CAPABILITY PACK<br/>implementing an existing port or extension point]
  C -->|New family of concepts with no owner<br/>e.g. a new industry primitive| U[Propose a NEW UNIVERSE<br/>CCP, constitutional class, 12-section spec]
  C -->|New dimension of existence<br/>e.g. new reality kind, new time-scale family| F[Extend U77 frame registry<br/>+ foundation conversion packs]
  D & K & P & U & F --> G[3. Add gap rules + tests]
  G --> T[4. Certify]
  T --> Reg[5. Update this register<br/>+ ontology + graph]
```

**Rules of the protocol**
1. **Search before create.** Duplicate-concept detection (U05 §5.1) blocks near-duplicates automatically.
2. **Prefer the lowest step.** Data is better than a new kind, a new kind better than a pack, a pack better than a new universe. A new universe is a last resort and needs Architecture Board approval.
3. **Frames first for "where, when, what money, what units, what language, which reality".** Anything about a new location system, time system, currency system, unit system, language system or reality starts in U77 and flows to U12, U13, U14, U15 and U16 automatically.
4. **Every addition brings its gap rules.** The platform must be able to say whether the new thing is missing anywhere it is needed.
5. **Every addition is certified** (U74) and **recorded here.** This register is regenerated from the registries and the knowledge graph (`ucos coverage --report`). It is a generated view, so it cannot drift from reality.
6. **Unknown unknowns:** the Discovery questions (U75 §5.2) run weekly. Repeated waivers, zero-result searches in the capability marketplace, unresolved builder intents, and unmapped regulatory or market signals become `OPPORTUNITY` insights for U76 Evolution. This is how things nobody listed get found.

### Z.1 Worked examples
| New requirement | Classification | What changes |
|---|---|---|
| Launch in Kenya | Data | Jurisdiction facts, holiday calendar, KES (already ISO), M-Pesa payment adapter (pack, if not present), KRA tax regime pack, Kenya Data Protection Act regulation pack. Zero code in existing universes. |
| Accept a new national payment method (e.g. Pix, PromptPay) | Pack | Adapter implementing `payment.provider@2` + method type registry entry. |
| Sell in Swahili, or in a constructed language | Data | Locale in U15 (BCP 47 or private-use), translations. |
| Support a Martian colony store | Kind + data + packs | Body `mars` (data), frame `mars-surface` (data), Darian calendar and MTC time scale (packs), colony monetary system (data), governing authority (data), jurisdictions (data), light-time SLA facts (data). Commerce universes are unchanged. |
| Commerce inside a metaverse world | Kind + data | Reality `virtual-world` instance, in-game monetary system, world-operator authority, RealityLink for physical redemption. |
| A brand-new industry primitive (e.g. carbon-credit retirement registry) | Universe or pack | Check U98/U99/U100 first. If no owner, propose a new universe through a constitutional change proposal. |
| A new regulation (e.g. new AI law) | Data | U67 regulation pack + control mappings + applicability rules. Gaps appear automatically for affected tenants. |
| A new interface (e.g. neural interface) | Kind + pack | U64 ChannelProfile + renderer pack + U66 data class `NEURAL` (restricted). |
