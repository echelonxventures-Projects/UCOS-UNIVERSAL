# Security policy

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's **Security → Report a vulnerability** on this repository. Do not open a public issue.

Include the affected component (universe, pack or tool), the impact, and steps to reproduce. You will get an acknowledgement within 3 business days and a triage decision within 10 business days. Fix timelines follow severity: critical 7 days, high 30 days, medium 90 days.

The threat models for each surface are in `docs/threat-models/`. Supply-chain rules (signed packs, SBOM, SLSA provenance) are in ADR-009 and gate `SEC-SUPPLY-01`.
