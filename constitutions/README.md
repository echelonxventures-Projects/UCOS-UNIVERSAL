# UCOS Universe Constitutions

This folder holds one detailed specification per universe. They are the second level of the UCOS documentation, below `../UCOS-MASTER-ARCHITECTURE.md`. Each spec follows `_TEMPLATE.md` (12 sections, per master §12.5) and MUST NOT contradict the master. Where a spec needs the master to change, it lists the change in its Appendix B. Those changes are collected below for a governed update.

## Shared conventions (apply to every spec)

| Item | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Universe id | `U<NN>-<slug>` | `U13-temporal` |
| Object type id | `<universe-slug>.<area>.<PascalName>` or `ucos.<slug>.<PascalName>` | `ucos.temporal.Reservation` |
| Object id | `ucos:<kind>:<ULID>`; reference data `ucos:<kind>:<ns>/<key>` | `ucos:tmp:01J…`, `ucos:jur:IN-KA` |
| Command | PascalCase verb phrase | `HoldReservation` |
| Permission / action | `<slug>:<Command>` | `temporal:HoldReservation` |
| Event type | `<slug>.<object-kebab>.<past-tense>` | `temporal.reservation.held` |
| REST | `/v1/<slug>/<collection>[/{id}][:command]` | `POST /v1/temporal/reservations/{id}:confirm` |
| Error code | `<SLUG-UPPER>_<REASON>` | `TMP_CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED` |
| Universe law | `<SLUG-UPPER>-L<n>` | `TMP-L4` |
| Lint rule | `<SLUG-UPPER>-LINT-<nnn>` | `META-LINT-001` |
| Certification gate | `<GATE>-<SLUG>-<nn>` | `ARCH-TMP-02` |
| Gap rules | Datalog, same predicate vocabulary as master §11.3 | `gap(kind, …) :- …` |
| Policies | Cedar | |
| Decision tables | `<slug>.<name>`, tenant-configurable, with defaults | `identity.required-aal` |

Communication is complete (U40 + U109). `spec/` checks clean: 165 manifests, 613 object-type schemas, 55 gates, 219 error codes, 0 errors, and three reference platform definitions (D2C IN+AE, B2B IN, omnichannel IN) compose with 0 gaps.

## Amendments register (to fold into the master via a governed change)

| # | From | Amendment |
|---|---|---|
| A-01 | U04 | Register `Classification` as a ValueType owned by U65 Security. |
| A-02 | U11 | Rename U11 to "Person & Party". It owns `Party`, `PartyRole`, `PartyRelationship` and `PartyRoleType`. Master §7.2: CID = PartyRole. |
| A-03 | U13 | Add `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalTimeWindow` and `BusinessDuration` value types to master §9.1. Add `SLADefinition` and `Schedule` to U13 "owns". |
| A-04 | U12 | Add `AddressFormat` and `GeocodeResult` to U12 "owns". |
| A-05 | U14 | Add `RoundingRule`, `RatePolicy`, `RateSource`, `Dimension` and `PackagingUnit` to U14 "owns". |
| A-06 | U09 | Add `RoleGrant`, `Delegation`, `FederatedProvider` and `VerificationRecord` to U09 "owns". |
| A-07 | U10 | Add `TenantLink` to U10 "owns". |
| A-08 | U16 | Master §7.6: `ContextEnvelope.jurisdiction` becomes a role-keyed map (actor, buyer-delivery, seller, data-storage, store). |
| A-09 | U01 | Authority object gains `quorum`. `Ratification` and `Annulment` become DecisionRecord types. |
| A-10 | U02 | Add `ChangeTemplate` and `ChangeWindow` to U02 "owns". |
| A-11 | U03 | Master §18.5 gains layered policy precedence (platform → emergency → universe-default/tenant/org) and `PartialEvaluate` for list queries. |
| A-12 | U61 | Master §15.5 gains event categories (domain, integration, system, signal, audit) and the claim-check rule for large payloads. |
| A-13 | U57 | Master §8.3 gains capability kinds `data-pack` and `ui-pack`, and the formal `PackRuntime` gRPC contract. |
| A-14 | U58 | Master §11.4 Blueprint gains `config`, `decisions`, `placement` and `adapters`. PlatformDefinition gains `overrides`. |
| A-15 | U65 | Master §19.7 gains ordered security profiles (standard < high < regulated < sovereign) and the data handling matrix. |
| A-16 | U73 | Master §27 gains `Placement` (sharding by jurisdiction) and `Activation` as first-class objects. |
| A-17 | U74 | Master §28.3 Certification gains `profile`, `subjectDigest` and a DSSE attestation. Invalidation of an active blueprint opens a grace period and never shuts it down automatically. |
| A-18 | U75 | Master §11.6 gains discovery gap kinds and `INSIGHT` severity. The fix catalog becomes a first-class object. |
| A-19 | U26 | Master §32 P1: the Ledger (U30) is absent in P1. Order and payment events are kept and replayed into it when U30 activates in P2. |
| A-20 | U72 | U72 explicitly owns `MetricDefinition`, `AlertRule`, `Experiment` and `FeatureFlag`. |
| A-21 | U66 | Every universe holding personal data implements the `privacy.dsr-handler` extension point (export, rectify, erase). Checked by gate `CMP-PRV-01`. |
| A-22 | U53/U04 | CEL is the single expression language for decisions, constraints and guards (FEEL is not used). |
| A-23 | U77→U12 | Geography becomes frame-aware: places belong to Bodies; jurisdictions can be governed by treaty, station, virtual-world or DAO authorities; address formats are keyed by (body, authority). |
| A-24 | U77→U13 | Temporal becomes frame-aware: time scales (TAI/MTC/LTC/world clocks), calendar systems, light-time facts, plus a synthetic-calendar golden test. |
| A-25 | U77→U14 | Currencies belong to monetary systems (`X-<system>-<code>` for non-ISO currencies); units belong to unit systems; 18-decimal precision for digital assets. |
| A-26 | U77→U15 | Locales belong to language systems; private-use tags for unregistered languages; sign and machine-protocol languages. |
| A-27 | U77→U16 | New Context dimension `frame`. The simulation flag is now derived from the reality kind. |
| A-28 | U77→U03 | Platform policy P-004 generalised to reality isolation with bridging. |
| A-29 | Review | Products and services completed: U78–U84 and U100 added; U18, U19, U21 and U22 extended (relationships, fitment, documents, product natures, listing-type delegation). |
| A-30 | U85 | `SegmentRef` now has an owner (CDP). |
| A-31 | U86 | Marketing campaign orchestration moves from U40 to U86; U40 delivers messages only. |
| A-32 | U87 | SEO and web presence added as a Phase 1 universe (needed by any public storefront). |
| A-33 | U88, U09 | Social & Community universe; social login added to Identity. |
| A-34 | U89 | Contract & Agreement gets a universe number (it was in the master mindmap without one). |
| A-35 | U90 | Global Trade & Customs gets an owner. |
| A-36 | U91 | Auctions, tenders and negotiation (including agent-to-agent) get an owner. |
| A-37 | U96 | Collaboration, projects and the universal comment thread capability. |
| A-38 | U97 | Forms, surveys and feedback. |
| A-39 | U98 | Sustainability and ESG, with anti-greenwashing rules. |
| A-40 | U95 | Git, CI/CD and definitions-as-code as a Phase 0 universe; Studio and Git kept in two-way sync. |
| A-41 | U93 | Data governance becomes a first-class universe (catalogue, contracts, lineage, quality, master data, sharing). |
| A-42 | U94 | Classical ML platform separated from LLMs and agents; one shared model registry with U49. |
| A-43 | U92 | IoT and devices (including robots and edge) get an owner. |
| A-44 | U99 | Digital assets and distributed ledgers (optional, jurisdiction-gated). |
| A-45 | U13 | Calendar and scheduling completeness: ICS calendar feeds, Google/Microsoft/CalDAV sync, invitations, multi-party availability search, waitlists, walk-in queue tokens, reminders, time off; canonical names for time fields; value-type vs service dependency kinds; gate `ARCH-TMP-05`. |
| A-46 | All | `TEMPORAL-BINDING-MATRIX.md` binds every universe's time needs to Temporal mechanisms. 27 specs gained the `U13 Temporal` dependency; planned universes must follow their matrix rows. |
| A-47 | All | Time-field cleanup: 108 informal time fields across 50 specs and the master document now have explicit Temporal types. Non-time fields that collided with the reserved names were renamed (`compareAt` → `compareAtPrice`, `offset` → `additiveOffset`, SLA `at` → `atElapsedPercent`, SLO `window` → `rollingWindow`/`lookback`, master `freshness` → `freshnessObjective`, `deadline` → `deadlineOffset`, model `retention` → `providerRetention`). The naming rule in U13 Appendix E.3 was corrected so `validUntil` and `effectiveFrom` are TimePoints, and it now lists reserved names. A re-scan finds 0 untyped time fields. |
| A-48 | U101 | Quality, Health, Safety & Environment universe (quality management, CAPA, audits, incidents, permits to work, environmental permits). |
| A-49 | U102 | Strategy & Performance (OKRs, scorecards, planning cycles). |
| A-50 | U103 | Corporate Governance & Equity (board, resolutions, cap table, ESOP, statutory filings). Board resolutions are evidence for U01 authorities. |
| A-51 | U104 | Legal Matters, Ethics & IP (matters, legal holds, whistleblowing, IP portfolio, brand protection and takedowns). |
| A-52 | U105 | Workplace & Facilities (spaces, desk and room booking, visitors, occupancy). |
| A-53 | U106 | Travel & Expense. |
| A-54 | U107 | Partner, Channel & Franchise (one owner for partner programs, deal registration, MDF, rebates, affiliates, franchise royalties). |
| A-55 | U08 | Reference vocabularies added for measuring completeness: ISIC Rev.4, NAICS, NACE, NIC, UN CPC 2.1, SAC, APQC PCF, BIAN, eTOM, ISCO-08, ISCED, WIPO classes, clinical code systems (licensed), plus crosswalks. |
| A-56 | U18 | Complete product-nature registry (21 natures, incl. living, perishable/cold chain, energy, real property, data, IP licences, environmental credits, permits/spectrum, labour time) and the `RegulatedGoodsProfile` model with enforcement points. |
| A-57 | U108 | Product Development, R&D & Innovation (stage-gate, design items and revisions, engineering BOM, engineering change, lab notebook / LIMS-lite, launch). |
| A-58 | U86 | Public relations added to Marketing Automation scope (`pr` campaigns, media monitoring via U88). |
| A-59 | All | `INDUSTRY-PRODUCT-DOMAIN-CATALOGUE.md` maps every ISIC division, CPC division and APQC category to owners, with an explicit out-of-scope register, completeness gap rules and the `ucos coverage` report. Temporal Binding Matrix extended to U101–U108. |
| A-60 | U40 / defaults | `communication.core` joins the base capability set, because transactional messages (OTP, order confirmations) are mandatory for every platform. Found by the checker: the D2C blueprint had no messaging capability. |
| A-61 | U28 | Entitlement platform plans and limits move to Phase 0, because tenant provisioning (U10, Phase 0) needs them. Found by the checker's phase-ordering rule. |
| A-62 | U01, U03, U07, U61, U29 | Pack manifests now require `temporal.core` wherever Temporal services are used (ARCH-TMP-05). Simulators were added for the FX and e-invoice ports (INT-L5). New abstract port `identity.federation-provider`. |
| A-63 | All Phase 1 specs | Phase 1 fallback appendices for dependencies on later-phase universes (U17, U30, U36, U41, U49, U54, U69). |
| A-64 | U40 | Communication completeness: channel registry (email, SMS, WhatsApp, web and mobile push, in-app, RCS, Telegram, LINE, WeChat, Viber, Messenger, Instagram, voice, video, live chat, postal, broadcast, agent-protocol); in-app notification centre; inbound routing with opt-out first; real-time conversations; broadcast and emergency alerts with dual approval; agent-to-agent protocol. `communication.inapp` and `communication.inbound` join the base capability set. |
| A-65 | U109 | Real-time Communications & Contact Centre universe: voice, IVR, masked calling, video sessions, live chat, bot hand-off, routing, call-backs, recordings with consent, supervision. |
| A-66 | spec/ | 23 new manifests (5 capabilities, 12 messaging adapters, the `rtc.provider` port, voice and video adapters, a simulator, contact centre, video sessions). New controls for recording consent and bot disclosure. `targetPhase` added to platform definitions. New reference platform `omnichannel-in` (Phase 4). A negative test confirms the checker blocks mobile, voice and video at Phase 1. |
| A-67 | U49–U51, U17, U25, U27, U30, U36, U59, U69, U70 | AI & Agents specs (gateway, prompts as code, agent run loop with autonomy levels and kill switch) and the Phase 2 core. Ledger posting rules are idempotent by `(sourceEventId, ruleId)`, which makes the P1 replay (A-19) deterministic. Marketplace payouts respect Temporal return-window holds. Subscription mandates follow RBI e-mandate and SCA MIT rules. Risk falls back to `unknown` and never to `low`. U59 registers `gen.schema.object-types` for `spec/object-types/`. |
| A-68 | U32, U33, U37–U39, U41, U45–U48, U52, U54–U56, U71, U76 | The remaining 16 universes are specified, so all 109 now have constitutions. Points are U84 stored value with U30 liability postings. Support owns cases while U109 owns routing. Every appeal goes to an independent human reviewer. Sponsored items are always labelled. Simulations run only in the `simulation` reality frame. Industry packs add composition but never fork a universe. |
| A-69 | spec/, tools/ | Machine-readable registries. `spec/certification/gates.yaml` holds 55 gates in 11 families with U74 profiles; every gate referenced anywhere is defined. `spec/registries/errors.yaml` holds 219 codes. `spec/object-types/` holds 613 schemas. The manifest generator moved into the repo as `tools/gen_manifests.py` and now derives `<slug>.core` manifests for the 56 universes without hand-authored ones. The checker enforces gates and registry sync. Naming-rule fixes in the new specs: `window` renamed to `rollingWindow`, `lookback`, `licenceRange`, `arrivalRange`, `biddingRange` and `responseDuration`. |
| A-70 | docs/ | `docs/adr/` holds ADR-001…020: the master's 001–012 plus CEL, U77 frames, communication base set, durable workflows, Go kernel, reference checker, derived manifests and RLS tenancy. Six open decisions are listed as Proposed. `docs/threat-models/` holds ten STRIDE models covering Phases 0–1 plus a P3 communication addendum. Manifests point at their model, and the checker enforces that the file exists (`SEC-TM-001`). |

## Open decisions raised by the specs

| From | Decision needed | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| U04 | Expression language for constraints and rules | **Decided:** CEL (A-22, ADR-013) |
| U08 | Licensing for GS1 GPC and UNSPSC redistribution | Legal review before P1 |
| U09 | Reference IdP: Keycloak or Ory | Load spike in P0, then decide |
| U10 | One tenant spanning several residency regions | Supported via multiple cells; spike in P2 |
| U12 | Boundary data source: OSM (ODbL) or commercial | Legal and cost review |
| U13 | Reservation counters at extreme peak: Postgres sharded sub-slots or Redis | Postgres first, then measure |
| U01 | Membership of the root authority (Architecture Board, at least 3 members with hardware keys) | Name members before the P0 genesis |
| U03 | OpenFGA for relationship-heavy (social graph) cases | Evaluate in P6 |
| U57 | gVisor sandbox for all third-party packs | Cost/benefit spike in P2 |
| U58 | Datalog engine: Soufflé or an embeddable Rust engine | P0 spike, weighing incremental evaluation |
| U65 | Scope of format-preserving tokenisation (non-PSP flows) | Confirm in P2 |
| U73 | Crossplane or plain OpenTofu for cell provisioning | OpenTofu modules wrapped by Crossplane |
| U18 | Global product data sourcing and licences (GS1 data pools, manufacturer syndication, licensed providers) | Commercial and legal workstream before P4 |
| U31 | Build or buy tax engines per regime | In-house packs for India and UAE in P1; engine adapters for US and EU |
| U60 | Workflow engine: Temporal.io or Camunda 8 | Temporal.io, with a BPMN import converter |
| U64 | Mobile renderer: React Native or Flutter | React Native; consider Flutter only if POS/kiosk performance requires it |
| U67 | Who owns legal interpretations in each jurisdiction | Organisational decision: in-house counsel plus external firms |
